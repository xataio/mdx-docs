The following SLA applies to the Xata Pro plan. The Xata free tier doesn't include an SLA, and the Xata Enterprise plan SLA can be customized. The SLA applies separately to each workspace.

## Service Level Agreement

The following Service Level Agreement (SLA) applies to the core Postgres database service, for both Shared and Dedicated Clusters. It includes access over the Postgres wire protocol as well as over the Data API.

| Monthly Uptime Percentage                          | Service Credit Percentage |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Less than 99.9% but equal to or greater than 99.0% | 10%                       |
| Less than 99.0% but equal to or greater than 95.0% | 25%                       |
| Less than 95.0%                                    | 100%                      |

## Service credits

Service Credits are calculated as a percentage of the charges paid by you for Xata for the monthly billing cycle in which the applicable SLA was not met. We will apply any Service Credits only against future Xata payments otherwise due from you. Service Credits may not be transferred or applied to any other account.

## Request credits

If you think the SLA was not met for a particular month, create a claim by opening a support ticket, either by visiting the [Xata Support portal](https://support.xata.io/hc/en-us) or by sending an email to `support@xata.io`. The claim must be received by Xata within thirty (30) days of the end of the billing cycle in which the SLA was not met. If the claim is confirmed, we will issue a credit to your account.

## Exclusions

- Functionality marked as Alpha or Beta is not part of the SLA.
- Delays in replication are not part of the SLA.
- Downtime caused by factors outside of our reasonable control, including any force majeure event or Internet access or related problems beyond the demarcation point of Xata is not part of the SLA.
