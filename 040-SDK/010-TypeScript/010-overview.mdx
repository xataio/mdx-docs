The Xata SDK supports TypeScript definitions for your Xata database schema. It also works with JavaScript.

It has zero dependencies and can run in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs), [V8](https://v8.dev/docs), [Deno](https://deno.com/), and [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

## Installation

We recommend installing the [Xata CLI](/docs/getting-started/cli) globally and importing the Xata Client from the [code generated](/docs/getting-started/cli#codegen) by the CLI.

When initializing the Xata CLI with the command `xata init` in a project, the `@xata.io/client` package is installed locally using the current project's package manager. In the event  
a package manager can't be determined, the Xata CLI will prompt you to manually install the `@xata.io/client` package.

## Usage

There are three ways to use the SDK:

1. Schema-generated Client: SDK to create/read/update/delete records in a given database following a schema file (with type-safety).
1. Schema-less Client: SDK to create/read/update/delete records in any database without schema validation (with partial type-safety).
1. API Client: SDK to interact with the whole Xata API and all its endpoints.

## Helper methods

The TypeScript SDK provides helper methods for creating types based off of Xata client-generated types.
The following are exported on the `@xata.io/client` package:

- `SelectableColumn` provides a type with the valid columns for a record.
- `SelectedPick` returns a subtype of the record with the requested fields.
- `EditableData` removes built-in record methods and reserved fields.

In the example below we create the type `myUser` with a selection of fields from the client-generated UserRecord:

```ts
import { getXataClient } from './xata';
import { SelectedPick, SelectableColumn, EditableData } from '@xata.io/client';
import { UserRecord } from './xata';

const xata = getXataClient();

const fields: SelectableColumn<UserRecord>[] = ['id', 'name', 'address'];

type myUser = EditableData<SelectedPick<UserRecord, typeof fields>>;
```

## Serializing Xata data-structures

Systems such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) expect the server to send [serialized data-structures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Serialization) to the client. Since the Xata SDK returns records as objects as well as strings, there's a need to serialize content for client-side use. Serialization transforms the data into a structured text format that can be easily sent and rebuilt on the client side.

Xata provides the `.toSerializable()` method within the record objects to help with serialization. To revert serialized data back to its original types on the client side, you can use the JSONData helper from `@xata.io/client`.

An example of a common pattern for this flow in a Next.js system:

```tsx title="/app/page.tsx"
import { getXataClient } from './xata';

const xata = getXataClient();

export default function Page({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  // Pull records from the "users" table
  const records = xata.db.users.getMany();

  // Serialize that content, turning any objects into strings
  const serializedRecords = records.toSerializable();

  // Pass the serialized content to the client component
  return <MyComponent records={serializedRecords} />;
}
```

The `MyComponent` client component can then use `JSONData` from the client to match against Xata's auto-generated types as shown below.

```tsx title="/components/MyComponent.tsx"
'use client';
import { FC } from 'react';
import { JSONData } from '@xata.io/client';
import { UserRecord } from './xata';

interface MyComponentProps {
  // The data we serialized still matches the UserRecord shape
  records: JSONData<UserRecord>;
}

export const MyComponent: FC<MyComponentProps> = ({ records }) => {
  return (
    <>
      {records.map((record) => {
        // Date objects were converted to strings during serialization.
        // We can always revert them to their original form here in the client, as needed
        const date = new Date(record.createdAt);
        const dateFormatted = date.toLocaleString();
        return <p>{dateFormatted}</p>;
      })}
    </>
  );
};
```
