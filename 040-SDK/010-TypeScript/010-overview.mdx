The Xata SDK supports typescript definitions for your Xata database schema. It also works with JavaScript.

It has zero dependencies and can run in Node.js, V8, Deno, and Bun.

## Installation

We recommend installing the [Xata CLI](/docs/getting-started/cli) globally and import the Xata Client from the [code generated](/docs/getting-started/cli#codegen) by the CLI.

When initializing the Xata CLI with the command `xata init` in a project, the `@xata.io/client` package is installed locally using the current project's package manager. In case no package manager can be determined, the Xata CLI will prompt you to install the `@xata.io/client` package manually.

## Usage

There are three ways to use the SDK:

- Schema-generated Client: SDK to create/read/update/delete records in a given database following a schema file (with type-safety).
- Schema-less Client: SDK to create/read/update/delete records in any database without schema validation (with partial type-safety).
- API Client: SDK to interact with the whole Xata API and all its endpoints.

## Helper methods

The TypeScript SDK provides helper methods for creating types based off of Xata client-generated types.
The following are exported on the `@xata.io/client` package:

- `SelectableColumn` provides a type with the valid columns for a Record.
- `SelectedPick` returns a subtype of the Record with the requested fields.
- `EditableData` removes built-in Record methods and reserved fields.

In the example below we create the type `myUser` with a selection of fields from the client-generated UserRecord:

```ts
import { getXataClient } from "./xata";
import { SelectedPick, SelectableColumn, EditableData } from "@xata.io/client";
import { UserRecord } from "./xata";

const xata = getXataClient();

const fields: SelectableColumn<UserRecord>[] = [
  "id",
  "name",
  "address",
];

type myUser = EditableData<SelectedPick<UserRecord, typeof fields>>;
```
