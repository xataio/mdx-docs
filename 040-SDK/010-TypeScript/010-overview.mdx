The Xata SDK supports typescript definitions for your Xata database schema. It also works with JavaScript.

It has zero dependencies and can run in Node.js, V8, Deno, and Bun.

## Installation

We recommend installing the [Xata CLI](/docs/getting-started/cli) globally and import the Xata Client from the [code generated](/docs/getting-started/cli#codegen) by the CLI.

When initializing the Xata CLI with the command `xata init` in a project, the `@xata.io/client` package is installed locally using the current project's package manager. In case no package manager can be determined, the Xata CLI will prompt you to install the `@xata.io/client` package manually.

## Usage

There are three ways to use the SDK:

- Schema-generated Client: SDK to create/read/update/delete records in a given database following a schema file (with type-safety).
- Schema-less Client: SDK to create/read/update/delete records in any database without schema validation (with partial type-safety).
- API Client: SDK to interact with the whole Xata API and all its endpoints.
