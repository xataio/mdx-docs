If you are currently a user of a `0.x` version of the Python SDK, and intend to upgrade the SDK version to `1.x`, please consider the following breaking changes. We documented all changes to promoted the SDK to GA in the ticket [xataio/xata-py#24](https://github.com/xataio/xata-py/issues/24).

## New API Response type

Status: `future breaking` [xataio/xata-py#101](https://github.com/xataio/xata-py/issues/101)

The response of an API used to of type `requests.Response`, this changed in favour of a custom class called [`ApiResponse`](https://github.com/xataio/xata-py/blob/main/xata/api_response.py). This class inherits the build in `dict` data type and hence allows to drop the previously needed `.json()` method to get access to data. The method `.json()` is still available, for a non-breaking upgrade, but pronounced deprecated and will be removed with the next major release. The properties `status_code` and `headers` are replicated. For further convenience you don't need to check the status code anymore, you can simply use the method `is_success()` to check if the request was successful.

In `0.x` getting a record required the `.json()` to access the data.

```python
post = xata.records().getRecord("Posts", "12345")
print(post.json()) # {"record": {"id": "12345", "title": "a blog post"}}
```

In `1.0.0` the response is implied to be a `dict` and ready to be used.

```python
post = xata.records().get("Posts", "12345")
print(post) # {"record": {"id": "12345", "title": "a blog post"}}

# alternatively, the legacy way using .json()
post = xata.records().get("Posts", "12345")
print(post.json()) # {"record": {"id": "12345", "title": "a blog post"}}
```

## Change of API surface

Status: `breaking` [xataio/xata-py#93](https://github.com/xataio/xata-py/issues/93)

The API surface was clunky with duplicate names, creating long function calls and did not comply with [pep-8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names) function names.

Listing all databases in `0.x`

```python
list = xata.databases().getDatabaseList()
```

changed to a more concise call in `1.x`:

```python
list = xata.databases().list()
```

Continously the function arguments are also converted to the pep-8 standard, lowercased and separated by an underscore, `SessionId` becomes `session_id`.

## Error Handling

### Renamed Exceptions

Status: `breaking`

In order to align with the [pep-8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#exception-names) standard that defines the naming to exceptions, the following classes were renamed:

- `UnauthorizedException` to `UnauthorizedError`
- `RateLimitException` to `RateLimitError`
- `ServerErrorException` to `XataServerError`

### Throwing errors on failed requests

If a requests results in a HTTP status code not in the `2xx` range, an error will be raised. The errors depend on the status code:

- `401`: `UnauthorizedError`
- `429`: `RateLimitError`
- `500`: `XataServerError`

## Removed deprecated methods

Status: `breaking` [xataio/xata-py#17](https://github.com/xataio/xata-py/issues/17)

The following methods were pronounced deprecated with the `0.7.0` release of the SDK and were removed with the `1.0.0` major version:

- `client.get()`
- `client.post()`
- `client.put()`
- `client.patch()`
- `client.delete()`
- `client.request()`
