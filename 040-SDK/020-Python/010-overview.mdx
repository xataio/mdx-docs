The Python SDK is available as a [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/xata/). It uses type annotations and requires Python 3.8 or higher. The API reference is located at https://xata-py.readthedocs.io.

## Installation

To install the library enter the following command:

```bash
pip install xata
```

The `xata` package is a standalone SDK library that features `XataClient`. By installing the package, you can import the SDK into your Python project and start building on top of Xata.

The Python SDK is different from the [Xata CLI](/docs/getting-started/installation#install-the-xata-cli) which can be used to manage your Xata databases from the command line or import the [Typescript and Javascript client](/docs/sdk/typescript/overview).

## Configuration

### Workspace URL

To bootstrap the SDK we recommend you use the workspace URL. In the [Web UI](https://app.xata.io), navigate to **Workspaces** then **Configuration**. You will be directed to the workspace API base URL. Copy the URL and use it to configure routing.

The URL can be passed to the client as a parameter:

```py
xata = XataClient(db_url="REDACTED_DB_URL")
```

Or you can set the environment variable: `XATA_DATABASE_URL`. The parameter value will take precedence over the environment variable.

The format of the database URL (`db_url`) parameter must follow the format of: `https://test-123456.us-east-1.xata.sh/db/mydb`. The branch name is not mandatory, it can be either appended to the URL, with a `:` as the separator, like this `https://test-123456.us-east-1.xata.sh/db/mydb:my-feature-branch`. Alternatively, you can specify the `branch_name` with the parameter in `XataClient`.

### Authorization

There are multiple options to pass your Xata credentials to the client. Xata will check the following using this order of precedence:

1.  Parameters passed to the constructor
1.  Environment variables
1.  The `.env` file
1.  Via `.xatarc` configuration file

The `.xatarc` file is generated by the [Xata CLI](/docs/getting-started/installation#install-the-xata-cli) in the current directory when running the command `xata init`.

#### dotenv

If the previous options were empty, the client looks for a `.env` file in the project root directory. Visit the [Authentication][0] page to read more about best practices.

```bash
XATA_API_KEY="REDACTED_API_KEY"
XATA_DATABASE_URL="REDACTED_DB_URL"
```

#### xatarc configuration file

The `.xatarc` configuration file is the final source to retrieve the API key and the workspace.
Refer to the [authentication][0] page to learn more about the `.xatarc` file and best practices.

#### Environment Variables

If no parameters passed, the client probes the following environment variables for authentication.

```bash
export XATA_API_KEY="REDACTED_API_KEY"
export XATA_DATABASE_URL="REDACTED_DB_URL"
```

```python
from xata.client import XataClient

client = XataClient()
```

#### Parameters

Inject the API key and workspace `id` directly into the constructor as a parameter:

```python
from xata.client import XataClient

client = XataClient(api_key="REDACTED_API_KEY", db_url="REDACTED_DB_URL")
```

## Selecting a Branch

There are multiple options to point the SDK to a specific branch, if none is selected, the SDK elects `main` as current branch name.

The environment variable `XATA_BRANCH` can specify a branch, the SDK will look for the variable and initialize the SDK with that value.

You can also, set the branch with the database URL (`db_url`) on SDK init, we want to use the branch `feature-042` on the database `Planes`, we can initialize the SDK with:

```python
xata = XataClient(db_url="https://test-12345.us-east-1.xata.sh/db/Planes:feature-042")
```

Another options is to specify the `branch_name` in the SDK. If you specify `db_url` and `branch_name`, the latter will be ignored.

If you want to change the branch for a single request, you can do so with all [workspace](/docs/contexts) endpoints, by setting the `branch_name`:

```python
xata.records().insert("Planes", record, branch_name="feature-042")
```

## Logging

The SDK builds on the [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) package and includes built-in logging support. By configuring the log level to debug, you can view the URL and status code by default.

## API Namespace

The API surface of the Python SDK is organized into namespaces, with each namespace associated with a specific set of APIs. For instance, the `databases` namespace provides access to all the available Xata endpoints for managing databases.

Alternatively, you can directly instantiate a namespace, as demonstrated in this [example](/docs/python-sdk/examples#get-a-record-from-a-table).
