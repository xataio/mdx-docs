Xata uses PostgreSQL under the hood to store your data. You can use SQL to work with your data. The results come back in a typical Xata JSON response mechanism over HTTP. If the Xata API doesn't cover the query you need, you can use SQL directly to do queries, insert data, update information, and delete records.

Xata offers support for a subset of PostgreSQL functions. This includes functions such as `subquery`, `comparison`, `aggregate`, `window`, `range`, `json`, `string`, `datetime`, and `array` functions. Functions beyond these are not permitted.

## Data model

Database tables are stored in PostgreSQL as tables. Xata data types are mapped to PostgreSQL types with additional constraints:

| Xata data type | PostgreSQL data type | Notes                              |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| string         | text                 |                                    |
| text           | text                 | With constraints on maximum length |
| int            | bigint               |                                    |
| float          | double precision     |                                    |
| datetime       | timestamptz          |                                    |
| bool           | boolean              |                                    |
| email          | text                 | Validated by Xata                  |
| multiple       | text[]               | Validated by Xata                  |
| file           | jsonb                | Validated by Xata                  |
| filearray      | jsonb                | Validated by Xata                  |
| link           | foreign key          |                                    |

In PostgreSQL tables are used to store and organize data. Linked columns serve as foreign keys, establishing connections to other tables. To access data from a linked column, use JOIN operations or apply WHERE conditions to locate the related records.

For example, the following query shows how to retrieve email addresses and corresponding cities using a `LEFT JOIN` operation between the "Users" and "address" tables.:

```sql
SELECT "Users".email, address.city FROM "Users"
LEFT JOIN address ON "Users".id=address.id;
```

For specific Xata data types like email, it is required you use the Xata API or SDK. This ensures that Xata can validate the inserted data's accuracy. We recommend refraining from directly writing to columns of this type and instead using the provided API for better results.

### Table and column names

Note when you are working with names that include upper-case
letters like `Users` or `zipCode`, you must quote those
otherwise PostgreSQL treats it as a lowercase name.

## API Endpoint

**URL:** `https://{workspace}.{region}.xata.sh/db/{db}:{branch}/sql`

- This URL represents the endpoint for making SQL queries within the Xata platform. It's intended to enable database interaction within a designated Workspace.

**Method:** `POST`

- The HTTP method used to interact with the provided URL is `POST`. This means you'll be sending data to the server, specifically your SQL statement and any additional parameters.

**Parameters:**

- `statement`: Your SQL statement (required).
- `params`: A list of parameters when submitting a parameterized statement.
- `consistency`: This parameter refers to the level of consistency when executing a statement. It offers options such as `strong` and `eventual`. The default setting is `strong`.

## Examples

The following are instances of working with data, including retrieving, selecting, inserting, and deleting records, using SQL in the Xata platform.

### Fetch all records

<TabbedCode tabs={['TypeScript', 'Python', 'JSON']}>

```ts
const { records } = await xata.sql<TeamsRecord>`SELECT * FROM teams`;
```

```python
records = xata.sql().query("SELECT * FROM \"teams\"")
```

```jsonc
// POST https://{workspace}.{region}.xata.sh/db/{db}:{branch}/sql

{
  "statement": "SELECT * FROM \"teams\""
}
```

</TabbedCode>

The following response is returned:

```json
{
  "records": [
    {
      "id": "rec_c8hng2h26un90p8sr7k0",
      "name": "Matrix",
      "owner": {
        "id": "myid"
      },
      "xata": {
        "version": 0,
        "createdAt": "2023-05-15T08:21:31.96526+01:00",
        "updatedAt": "2023-05-15T21:58:54.072595+01:00"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Select a subset of columns from your table

<TabbedCode tabs={['TypeScript', 'Python', 'JSON']}>

```ts
const { records } = await xata.sql<TeamsRecord>`SELECT name, city FROM "Users"`;
```

```python
records = xata.sql().query("SELECT name, city FROM \"Users\"")
```

```jsonc
// POST https://{workspace}.{region}.xata.sh/db/{db}:{branch}/sql

{
  "statement": "SELECT name, city FROM \"Users\""
}
```

</TabbedCode>

Response:

```json
{
  "records": [
    {
      "city": "New York",
      "name": "Keanu Reaves"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Insert a new record using a parameterized query

<TabbedCode tabs={['TypeScript', 'Python', 'JSON']}>
```ts
const user = { name: "Keanu Reeves", email: "keanu@example.com" };
const { records: [record] } = await xata.sql<TeamsRecord>`INSERT INTO "Users" (name, email) VALUES (${user.name}, ${user.email})`;
```
```python
records = xata.sql().query(
  "INSERT INTO \"Users\" (name, email) VALUES ($1, $2)",
  ["Keanu Reeves", "keanu@example.com"]
)
```
```jsonc
// POST https://{workspace}.{region}.xata.sh/db/{db}:{branch}/sql

{
"statement": "INSERT INTO \"Users\" (name, email) VALUES ($1, $2)",
"params": ["Keanu Reeves", "keanu@example.com"]
}

````
</TabbedCode>

### Delete record using a parameterized query

<TabbedCode tabs={['TypeScript', 'Python', 'JSON']}>
```ts
const user = { id: "my-user-id" };
await xata.sql<TeamsRecord>`DELETE FROM "Users" WHERE id=${user.id})`;
````

```python
xata.sql().query(
  "DELETE FROM \"Users\" WHERE id=$1",
  ["my-record-id"]
)
```

```jsonc
// POST https://{workspace}.{region}.xata.sh/db/{db}:{branch}/sql

{
  "statement": "DELETE FROM  \"Users\" WHERE id=$1",
  "params": ["my-record-id"]
}
```

</TabbedCode>

## Limitations

When using SQL in Xata, there are a few constraints to keep in mind.

### Data retrieval

- The `xata.*` internal fields are read-only. You cannot modify these fields.
- You can only submit one statement per request.
- Xata returns 1000 records at a time. Access your data using `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` to iterate and work through your data.
- JSON formatter functions do not work as the endpoint already returns a JSON response.
- The `work_mem` setting in PostgreSQL is set to 4 MB. so a query can use only 4 MB of memory (before writing to temp files)

### Resource consumption

- In PostgreSQL, the `work_mem` configuration is set to 4 MB. A query is limited to 4 MB of memory and this limit is enforced before the data is saved into temporary files. The `work_mem` configuration sets the baseline maximum memory for query operations like sorting or using hash tables before writing to temporary disk file.
- The `hash_mem_multiplier` is set to `1`. The `hash_mem_multiplier` computes the maximum memory for hash-based operations by multiplying it by `work_mem`. For additional information on resource consumption in Postgres, see the [PostgreSQL docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-resource.html).

### Column names

Columns with matching names overwrite each other by default. To address this, especially when dealing with multiple columns that have the same name, you can use column aliasing as a solution. For instance:

```sql
SELECT address AS physical_address, address AS email
FROM people, emails
WHERE people.id=emails.id;
```

By assigning aliases, you can distinguish between columns with similar names and manage them effectively.

### Unsupported commands

Certain commands are not supported in Xata:

- Data definition language (DDL) commands such as `CREATE`, `DROP`, `ALTER` and `TRUNCATE` are not supported.

- Data control language (DCL) commands such as `GRANT` and `REVOKE` are not supported.

- Transaction control language (TCL) commands such as `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`, `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT`, and `SET TRANSACTION` are not supported.

### Connection methods

SQL access in Xata is achieved via an HTTP or HTTPS proxy. Tools that use a wire protocol with a connection string to PostgreSQL are not compatible with Xata's SQL proxy.

You can use SQL in Xata with any of the following methods:

- Use the built-in PostgreSQL Playground in the Xata Web UI.
- Execute API calls to your branch's `/sql` endpoint using web clients such as Postman.
- Use the SQL methods provided in the Typescript and Python SDKs.
- Use the [Kysely](/docs/integrations/kysely) and [Drizzle](/docs/integrations/drizzle) integrations.
