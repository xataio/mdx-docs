<Alert status="info">
  Please be aware that the Go SDK is still in *beta*. Not all endpoints are covered in the SDK and potential breaking changes may occur before the promotion to a `1.0.0` and stability GA release.
</Alert>

Intro text + repo link: https://github.com/xataio/xata-go

## Installation

dependency name + go.mod

## Configuration

The client probes the following environment variables for authentication.

```bash
export XATA_API_KEY="REDACTED_API_KEY"
export XATA_DATABASE_URL="REDACTED_DB_URL"
```

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	
	"github.com/xataio/xata-go/xata"
)

func main() {
	workspaces, err := xata.NewWorkspacesClient()
    resp, _ := workspaces.List(context.Background())
    fmt.Printf("%#v\n", *resp.Workspaces[0])
}
```

## Endpoint Coverage

As indicated the SDK is still in development, this also means that some endpoints are not available at the moment. You can check the coverage [here](https://github.com/xataio/xata-go/issues/1).
