<Alert status="warning">
The Go SDK is currently in *alpha*. This means that it does not include all endpoints and is subject to potential breaking changes before reaching its `1.0.0` stable General Availability (GA) release.
</Alert>

The Go SDK is available on GitHub: https://github.com/xataio/xata-go

## Configuration

The client needs a `XATA_API_KEY` environment variables for authentication and the `.xatarc` file for the database URL. Refer to [our installation guide](/docs/getting-started/installation#xatarc) to initialize your project with the `.xatarc` file.

## Example

The following example demonstrates the basic usage of the SDK and how to pull the workspaces and list the first one:

```go
package main

import (
  "context"
  "fmt"

  "github.com/xataio/xata-go/xata"
)

func main() {
  workspaces, _ := xata.NewWorkspacesClient()
  resp, _ := workspaces.List(context.TODO())
  fmt.Printf("%#v\n", *resp.Workspaces[0])
}
```

### Runnable Example

You can run the snippet from above on your machine by, pulling the example code from the xataio/xata-go repository

```bash
wget -O example.go "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xataio/xata-go/main/examples/list_workspaces.go"
go mod edit -module=example.com/mod
go mod download github.com/xataio/xata-go@main
```

Run the code with the command

```bash
XATA_API_KEY="<INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY>" go run exmaple.go
```

## Known Limitations

- [Numeric operations](/docs/sdk/update#numeric-operations) are currently not supported via the update API, as a workaround you can use the transaction API [example](/docs/sdk/transaction).
- Not all Xata endpoints are available at the alpha state of the SDK. You can check the coverage [here](https://github.com/xataio/xata-go/issues/1).
