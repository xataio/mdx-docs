<Alert status="warning">
  The Go SDK is currently in *alpha*. This means that it does not include all endpoints and is subject to potential
  breaking changes before reaching its `1.0.0` stable General Availability (GA) release.
</Alert>

The Go SDK is available on GitHub: https://github.com/xataio/xata-go

## Install

```bash
go get github.com/xataio/xata-go@latest
```

## Configuration

The client needs a `XATA_API_KEY` environment variables for authentication and the `.xatarc` file for the database URL. Refer to [our installation guide](/docs/getting-started/installation#xatarc) to initialize your project with the `.xatarc` file.

## Example

After setting up your project and adding Xata credentials, create an example Go file.

The following example code demonstrates using the SDK to connect to Xata, retrieve a list of workspaces, and then print out details of the first workspace in the list.

In your text editor, paste the following code into your `example.go` file and save the file:

```go
package main

import (
  "context"
  "fmt"

  "github.com/xataio/xata-go/xata"
)

func main() {
  workspaces, _ := xata.NewWorkspacesClient()
  resp, _ := workspaces.List(context.TODO())
  fmt.Printf("%#v\n", *resp.Workspaces[0])
}
```

In the terminal, enter `go run .` to run the code.

The code snippet calls `workspaces.List(ctx)` API to list all workspaces and prints the details of the first workspace with `fmt.Printf("%#v\n", *resp.Workspaces[0])`.

### Runnable Example

You can run the snippet from above on your machine by, pulling the example code from the xataio/xata-go repository

```bash
wget -O example.go "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xataio/xata-go/main/examples/list_workspaces.go"
go mod edit -module=example.com/mod
go mod download github.com/xataio/xata-go@main
```

Run the code with the command:

```bash
XATA_API_KEY="<INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY>" go run example.go
```

## Known Limitations

- [Numeric operations](/docs/sdk/update#numeric-operations) are currently not supported using the update API. As a workaround, you can use the transaction API [example](/docs/sdk/transaction).
- Not all Xata endpoints are available at the alpha state of the SDK. You can check the coverage [here](https://github.com/xataio/xata-go/issues/1).
- Currently, there is no option to change the [consistency](/docs/concepts/data-model#consistency) and the default setting is `strong`.
