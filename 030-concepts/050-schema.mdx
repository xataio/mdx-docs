# Schema

Xata databases are described by a **schema**. A schema describes each table in the database, and the relationships between tables. Xata schemas are expressed as code in JSON and used by our internal systems, as well as the [Command Line Interface](/getting-started/cli) to work with your database.

## Understanding the Schema

Let's look at a JSON representation of a sample Xata schema to understand how it describes a database.

```json
{
  "tables": [
    {
      "name": "teams",
      "columns": [
        {
          "name": "name",
          "type": "string",
          "unique": true
        },
        {
          "name": "labels",
          "type": "multiple"
        },
        {
          "name": "owner",
          "type": "link",
          "link": {
            "table": "users"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "users",
      "columns": [
        {
          "name": "email",
          "type": "email"
        },
        {
          "name": "full_name",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "name": "address",
          "type": "object",
          "columns": [
            {
              "name": "street",
              "type": "string"
            },
            {
              "name": "zipcode",
              "type": "int"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "name": "team",
          "type": "link",
          "link": {
            "table": "teams"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### `tables`

The `tables` field is an array (a collection) of objects, each representing a table. Every table has a unique `name`, and a set of `columns`. Table names must be case-insensitive unique within a database schema. Each column is described by the following set of fields.

These fields are **required**:

- `name`: A unique name for the column. Valid column names contain only alphanumerics and the '-', '\_', or '~' characters. Column names must be case-insensitive unique in a table.
- `type`: The type of data intended to be stored in this column. For a detailed description of each column type, please see the [Column Types](/concepts/data-model#column-types) section.

These fields are **optional**:

- `unique`: A boolean value answering the question "is every value in this column expected to be unique?"
- `notNull`: A boolean value answering the question "is this column exected to have data?"
- `defaultValue`: The default value of the column, if nothing is provided.

## Loading the Schema from a File

You can initialize a Xata database with a schema from a JSON file by passing it to the init command:

```bash
xata init --schema=schema.json
```

For a more complete example see the [API Guide](/typescript-client/overview).

## Editing the Schema

You can edit the schema in a variety of ways:

- From the web UI in the Schema menu or in the Table view.
- From the [CLI](/getting-started/cli#schema) using commands such as `xata schema edit` or `xata schema upload`.
- From the Typescript/Javascript SDK using the `XataApiClient`.
