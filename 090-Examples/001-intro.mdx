## What can you build with Xata?

Xata is a versatile platform equipped with resources to help kickstart your data projects. In addition to our [getting started guides](/docs/getting-started/intro), Xata offers practical examples that demonstrate how to use create apps with various technologies and services. Explore the Xata example apps for a deeper understanding of how Xata can enhance your development experience.

The following material is available in the `apps` folder of the [examples repository](https://github.com/xataio/examples/tree/main/apps):

### Getting started guides

Getting started guides, also referred to as a framework starter guides, provide step-by-step instructions for using Xata with a popular framework. These guides walk you through the process of using the Xata CLI alongside frameworks to set up databases, define schemas, import CSVs, generate TypeScript code, and implement advanced querying techniques. For more in-depth information, refer to our comprehensive [framework starter guides](/docs/getting-started/intro) or explore the app examples prefixed with `getting-started-` in the [repository](https://github.com/xataio/examples/tree/main/apps).

### Sample use cases

Our samples provide step-by-step guidance for using Xata in your projects. Whether it's for user authentication or handling image and file uploads and storage, these examples offer a clear solution.
