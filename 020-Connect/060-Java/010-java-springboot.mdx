To connect to Xata with [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) you to adjust your application config as follows.

```properties title="application.properties"
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://<REGION>.sql.xata.sh:5432/<DATABASE_NAME>:<BRANCH>
spring.datasource.username=<WORKSPACE_ID>
spring.datasource.password=<API_KEY>
```

Analogous, if you are using a yaml file:

```yaml title="application.yml"
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://<REGION>.sql.xata.sh:5432/<DATABASE_NAME>:<BRANCH>
    username: <WORKSPACE_ID>
    password: <API_KEY>
```

Please replace the parameters as indicated on the [connect to Postgres](/docs/postgres) page.

With a shared cluster you are subject to [connection limits](/docs/postgres#connection-limits), meaning how many connections can be active concurrently.
In order to avoid running into max open connection limit reached, please adjust the maximum pool size to 20 for free plan - and 60 for pro plan users.

```properties title="application.properties"
spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=20
```

A [dedicated cluster](/docs/dedicated-cluster) does not have any connection limits in place.
