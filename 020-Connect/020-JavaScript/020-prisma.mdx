[Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/orm) is a TypeScript ORM that is focused on type safety and developer experience.

## Installation

Prisma currently only works with Xata databases that are set up with the ability to make direct Postgres connections. Follow the instructions below to learn how to configure Prisma to work with Xata in this method.

### Create a Postgres enabled database in Xata

<DocsEnablePostgres />

### Install Prisma

You can use the following package managers:

<TabbedCode tabs={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>

```sh
npm install prisma
```

```sh
pnpm add prisma
```

```sh
yarn add prisma
```

</TabbedCode>

## Usage

To use Xata with Prisma define a postgresql datasource in the `schema.prisma` file. Here is an example:

```ts
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

You can manually define the schema or use the introspection feature to generate the schema from the database.

To introspect the database, you can use the following command:

```sh
prisma db pull
```

To generate the client, you can use the following command:

```sh
prisma generate
```

After generating the client, you can use it in your code. Here is an example of using the client:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

const prisma = new PrismaClient({});

const result = await prisma.users.findMany({
  where: {
    name: 'Alice'
  }
});
```

## Limitations

- Xata File Storage is read-only and only shows file metadata. You need to use the SDK to upload and download files.
- Prisma migrate is not yet fully supported. You need to use the Xata CLI to manage the [database migrations](/docs/migrations).
