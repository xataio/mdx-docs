[Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/orm) is a TypeScript ORM that is focused on type safety and developer experience.

## Installation

Prisma currently only works with Xata databases that are set up with the ability to make [direct Postgres connections](/docs/postgres). Follow the instructions below to learn how to configure Prisma to work with Xata in this method.

<DocsEnablePostgres />

### Install Prisma

You can use the following package managers:

<TabbedCode tabs={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>

```sh
npm install prisma
```

```sh
pnpm add prisma
```

```sh
yarn add prisma
```

</TabbedCode>

## Usage

To use Xata with Prisma define a postgresql datasource in the `schema.prisma` file. Here is an example:

```ts
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
  shadowDatabaseUrl = env("SHADOW_DATABASE_URL")
}
```

You can manually define the schema or use the introspection feature to generate the schema from the database.

To introspect the database, you can use the following command:

```sh
prisma db pull
```

Introspection is necessary after _Adapting_ an existing table in the UI. This action adds columns `xata_id`,`xata_createdat`,`xata_updatedat` to the table. `prisma db pull` updates the Prisma schema to include these.

To generate the client, you can use the following command:

```sh
prisma generate
```

After generating the client, you can use it in your code. Here is an example of using the client:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

const prisma = new PrismaClient({});

const result = await prisma.users.findMany({
  where: {
    name: 'Alice'
  }
});
```

## Shadow Database for Migrations

Migrations with Prisma require a [Shadow Database](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/understanding-prisma-migrate/shadow-database), which is an extra database that stores migration information and state.

Create an additional database in Xata (we recommend naming it databasename-migrations), configure this database's [Postgres connection string](/docs/postgres#connection-string) as the `shadowDatabaseUrl` in the Prisma datasource and store the connection string in your `.env` file as `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL`. Refer to Prisma's [documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/understanding-prisma-migrate/shadow-database#cloud-hosted-shadow-databases-must-be-created-manually) for more details.

## Limitations

- Xata [File attachments](/docs/sdk/file-attachments) columns are read-only and only show file metadata. You will need to use the [SDK](/docs/sdk/typescript/overview) to upload and download files.
