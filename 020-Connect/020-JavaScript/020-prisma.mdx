[Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/orm) is a TypeScript ORM that is focused on type safety and developer experience.

### Installation

Install prisma client. You can use the following package managers:

<TabbedCode tabs={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>
```sh
npm install prisma
```

```sh
pnpm add prisma
```

```sh
yarn add prisma
```

</TabbedCode>

### Usage

You can use Prisma with Xata with the default postgres client. To do so, you need to define the schema in the `schema.prisma` file. Here is an example of a schema:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

You can manually define the schema or use the introspection feature to generate the schema from the database.

To introspect the database, you can use the following command:

```sh
prisma db pull
```

To generate the client, you can use the following command:

```sh
prisma generate
```

After generating the client, you can use it in your code. Here is an example of using the client:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

const prisma = new PrismaClient({});

const result = await prisma.users.findMany({
  where: {
    name: 'Alice'
  }
});
```

### Limitations

- Xata File Storage is read-only and only shows file metadata. You need to use the SDK to upload and download files.
- Prisma migrate is not fully supported. You need to use the Xata CLI to manage the database migrations.
