[Drizzle](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm) is a TypeScript ORM that is focused on type safety and closely follows the SQL syntax.

### Installation

Install both Drizzle and `@xata.io/drizzle` with the Xata client. You can use the following package managers:

<TabbedCode tabs={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>
```sh
npm install drizzle-orm @xata.io/drizzle @xata.io/client
```

```sh
pnpm add drizzle-orm @xata.io/drizzle @xata.io/client
```

```sh
yarn add drizzle-orm @xata.io/drizzle @xata.io/client
```

</TabbedCode>

### Usage

You can use Drizzle with a Xata, as demonstrated in the following examples:

```tsx
import { pgTable, text } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';
import { drizzle } from '@xata.io/drizzle';
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { getXataClient } from './xata'; // Generated client

const xata = getXataClient();

const drivers = pgTable('drivers', {
  id: text('id').primaryKey(),
  surname: text('surname'),
  forename: text('forename'),
  nationality: text('nationality')
});

const db = drizzle(xata);

const result = await db
  .select({ surname: drivers.surname, forename: drivers.forename })
  .from(drivers)
  .where(eq(drivers.nationality, 'Spanish'))
  .execute();
```

The code imports required modules from the `drizzle-orm` and `@xata.io/drizzle` libraries. It also brings in the `eq` function from `drizzle-orm` for value comparison and the `getXataClient` function from a local xata module. The `getXataClient` function is used to acquire an instance of the Xata client.

Currently, we recommend manually defining the schema like in the example above. We are working on utility functions to automatically generate the Drizzle model from the Xata database schema.

### Limitations

- Drizzle migrations are not supported yet
- Transactions are not supported yet
