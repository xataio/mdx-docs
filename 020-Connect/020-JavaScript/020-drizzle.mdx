[Drizzle](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm) is a TypeScript ORM that is focused on type safety and closely follows the SQL syntax.

### Installation

Install both Drizzle and `@xata.io/drizzle` with the Xata client. You can use the following package managers:

<TabbedCode tabs={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>
```sh
npm install drizzle-orm @xata.io/drizzle @xata.io/client
```

```sh
pnpm add drizzle-orm @xata.io/drizzle @xata.io/client
```

```sh
yarn add drizzle-orm @xata.io/drizzle @xata.io/client
```

</TabbedCode>

### Usage

You can use Drizzle with Xata with a HTTP client or a TCP client. The HTTP client doesn't create a persistent connection to the Xata server, while the TCP client does and can be used for better performance with a higher number of requests.

To create a drizzle instance with the HTTP client, use the following code:

```ts
import { drizzle } from '@xata.io/drizzle';
import { getXataClient } from './xata'; // Generated client

const xata = getXataClient();
const db = drizzle(xata);
```

To create a drizzle instance with the TCP client, use the following code:

```ts
import { drizzle } from '@xata.io/drizzle/pg';
import { getXataClient } from './xata'; // Generated client
import { Client } from 'pg';

const xata = getXataClient();
const client = new Client({ connectionString: xata.sql.connectionString });
const db = drizzle(client);
```

A full example of using Drizzle with Xata is shown below:

```ts
import { pgTable, text } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';
import { drizzle } from '@xata.io/drizzle';
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { getXataClient } from './xata'; // Generated client

const xata = getXataClient();

const drivers = pgTable('drivers', {
  id: text('id').primaryKey(),
  surname: text('surname'),
  forename: text('forename'),
  nationality: text('nationality')
});

const db = drizzle(xata);

const result = await db
  .select({ surname: drivers.surname, forename: drivers.forename })
  .from(drivers)
  .where(eq(drivers.nationality, 'Spanish'))
  .execute();
```

The code imports required modules from the `drizzle-orm` and `@xata.io/drizzle` libraries. It also brings in the `eq` function from `drizzle-orm` for value comparison and the `getXataClient` function from a local xata module. The `getXataClient` function is used to acquire an instance of the Xata client.

Currently, we recommend manually defining the schema like in the example above. Alternatively, you can try to use `drizzle-kit` [experimental feature](https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/commands#introspect--pull) to generate the schema from the database.

### Limitations

- Transactions are not supported in the HTTP client.
