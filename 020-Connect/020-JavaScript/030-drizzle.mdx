[Drizzle](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm) is a TypeScript ORM that is focused on type safety and closely follows the SQL syntax.

## Installation

Drizzle currently only works with Xata databases that are set up with the ability to make [direct Postgres connections](/docs/postgres). Follow the instructions below to learn how to configure Drizzle to work with Xata in this method.

<DocsEnablePostgres />

### Install Drizzle

You can use the following package managers:

<TabbedCode tabs={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>

```sh
npm install drizzle-orm @xata.io/client@next
```

```sh
pnpm add drizzle-orm @xata.io/client@next
```

```sh
yarn add drizzle-orm @xata.io/client@next
```

</TabbedCode>

If you want to use the TCP client, you need to install the `pg` package as well:

<TabbedCode tabs={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>

```sh
npm install pg
```

```sh
pnpm add pg
```

```sh
yarn add pg
```

</TabbedCode>

## Usage

Drizzle works with Xata as a HTTP client or a TCP client. The HTTP client doesn't create a persistent connection to the Xata server, while the TCP client does and can be used for better performance with a higher number of requests.

To create a drizzle instance with the HTTP client, use the following code:

```ts
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/xata-http';
import { getXataClient } from './xata'; // Generated client

const xata = getXataClient();
const db = drizzle(xata);
```

To create a drizzle instance with the TCP client, use the following code:

```ts
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/node-postgres';
import { getXataClient } from './xata'; // Generated client
import { Client } from 'pg';

const xata = getXataClient();
const client = new Client({ connectionString: xata.sql.connectionString });
await client.connect();
const db = drizzle(client);
```

For production use cases, you can create a pool of connections with the TCP client:

```ts
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/node-postgres';
import { getXataClient } from './xata'; // Generated client
import { Pool } from 'pg';

const xata = getXataClient();
const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: xata.sql.connectionString, max: 20 });
const db = drizzle(pool);
```

> Depending on your current plan, you may need to adjust the `max` value to match your plan's [connection limit](/docs/rest-api/limits).

## Example

A full example of using Drizzle with Xata is shown below:

```ts
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/node-postgres';
import { pgTable, text } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { getXataClient } from './xata'; // Generated client

const xata = getXataClient();

const actors = pgTable('Actors', {
  id: text('id').primaryKey(),
  name: text('name'),
  city: text('city')
});

const db = drizzle(xata);

const result = await db
  .select({ name: actors.name, city: actors.city })
  .from(actors)
  .where(eq(actors.city, 'New York'))
  .execute();
```

The code imports required modules from the `drizzle-orm` libraries. It also brings in the `eq` function from `drizzle-orm` for value comparison and the `getXataClient` function from a local xata module. The `getXataClient` function is used to acquire an instance of the Xata client.

Currently, we recommend manually defining the schema like in the example above. Alternatively, you can try to use `drizzle-kit` [experimental feature](https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/commands#introspect--pull) to generate the schema from the database.

## Limitations

- Transactions are not supported in the HTTP client.
- Drizzle Kit introspection has a bug with our xata_id default value. You need to manually wrap the value with backticks.
- Xata [File attachments](/docs/sdk/file-attachments) columns are read-only and only shows file metadata. You will need to use the [SDK](/docs/sdk/typescript/overview) to upload and download files.
