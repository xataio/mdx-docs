This page shows you how to connect to Postgres, by explaining how a connection string is built, the different parameters and examples to connect via [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html).

## Connection string

The connection string to connect to Postgres needs to be in the following format:

```
postgresql://[User]:[Password]@[Host]:[Port]/[Database]
```

The following conversion table illustrates how the connection string parameters are mapped to Xata.

| Postgres | Xata                       | Example                 |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| User     | Workspace Id               | `ws1234`                |
| Password | API key                    | `xau_apikey123456`      |
| Host     | Region plus `.sql.xata.sh` | `us-east-1.sql.xata.sh` |
| Port     | `5432` or empty            | `5432`                  |
| Database | Database and branch name   | `Games:main`            |

With the example values from above, the connection string to connect to our database `Games` on branch `main` is constructed as:

```
postgresql://ws1234:xau_apikey123456@us-east-1.sql.xata.sh:5432/Games:main
```

The connection strings for HTTP access and Postgres wire protocol access are shown to you when you create a new database. You can always see how the connection string is constructed later on by navigating to the database settings page.
![Database settings showing connection strings](images/connection-string.png)

To create a new API key, or manage your existing ones, you need to open your [account settings](https://app.xata.io/settings).

Using psql to connect to your database, based off the previously constructed connection string with the example values:

```bash
psql "postgresql://ws1234:xau_apikey123456@us-east-1.sql.xata.sh:5432/Games:main"

Games:main=>
```

## Supported versions

The Postgres version depends on your deployment and plan.
In a shared cluster, you operate in a multi tenant environment, sharing the same Postgres version. Minor version upgrades are continuously updated.

If you want control of the version, you should consider a [dedicated cluster](/docs/dedicated-cluster#supported-versions).

You can check the Postgres version with the following command:

```bash
psql "postgresql://[Workspace Id]:[API key]@[Region].sql.xata.sh:[Port]/[Database]:[Branch]" -c "select version()"
```

```sql
                                                   version
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 PostgreSQL 15.4 on aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu, compiled by aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc (GCC) 9.5.0, 64-bit
(1 row)
```

## Extensions

In a shared cluster, no extension except the mandatory [plpgsql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpgsql.html) is installed and installing others is forbidden.
If you need extensions, you need to deploy a [dedicated cluster](/docs/dedicated-cluster#Extensions).

## Export your database branch with pg_dump

In order to export a branch with pg_dump, you need to specify the connection parameters as indicated in the [connection string](#connection-string) section.

```bash
pg_dump --no-acl --no-owner --no-comments --no-table-access-method --host=[Region].sql.xata.sh --username=[Workspace Id] --dbname=[Database]:[Branch] --password
```

The prompt will ask you for the password, which is your API key.

The flags, `--no-acl`, `--no-owner`, `--no-comments` and `--no-table-access-method` are not mandatory, but remove unnecessary noise in the file, creating a cleaner output.

Please refer to the pg_dump [documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html) for a full list of features.

## Import

The import path depends on your data format, if it's a compressed archive (e.g. `.tar`), you need to use [pg_restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgrestore.html).
pg_dump offers the flag `--format=tar` to immediately output to tar file format.

```bash
pg_restore --host=[Region].sql.xata.sh --username=[Workspace Id] --dbname=[Database]:[Branch] --password dumpdata.tar
```

The parameters are equally organized as for pg_dump.

If the file is a plain SQL file (`.sql`), you can convenitently use psql to immediately import the database branch.
In the following example, we want to import the file `my_branch.sql` into the database `playground` on the branch `new_branch`

```bash
psql "postgresql://[Workspace Id]:[API key]@[Region].sql.staging-xata.dev/playground:new_branch" < my_branch.sql
```

## Adapt my Table

A table created through the wire protocol, is not automatically equiped with the necessary columns to make use of Xata's other features, like a functioning UI, or full text search, etc.
In order to unlock the functionality, you need to adapt your table.
If you access the UI, you will see the following dialog on the page of the table itself:

![Adapt my table](images/adapt-my-table.png)

Or if you navigate to the schema view:

![Adapt my table in schema view](images/adapt-my-table-schema.png)

If you click adapt table, Xata will add four new columns to your table:

- `xata_id`: internal unique record identifier.
- `xata_version`: discrete version counter of the record, every update will increment the counter by one.
- `xata_createdat`: datetime in UTC of the record's creation
- `xata_updatedat`: datetime in UTC of the record's most recent update. If none happened, then the value is equal to the creation datetime.

Please reference to the [special columns](/docs/concepts/data-model#special-columns) section to learn more about these columns.

## Supported statements

Xata offers different approaches to Postgres, from SQL over HTTP to pure Postgres over the wire protocol to a shared or [dedicated cluster](/docs/dedicated-cluster).
Each come with a security scope to provide isolation in a multi tenant environment.

|                   | Functions | DQL statements | (some) DML statements | DDL statements |
| ----------------- | --------- | -------------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| SQL over HTTP     | N         | Y              | Y                     | Y              |
| Shared cluster    | N         | Y              | Y                     | Y              |
| Dedicated cluster | Y         | Y              | Y                     | Y              |

## Limitations

### Unsupported statements and functions

The following statements and/or functions are not available:

- `SELECT user`
- `SHOW password_encryption`
- `SET ROLE`
- `RESET ROLE`
- `SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION`
- `ALTER TABLESPACE`
- `CREATE TABLESPACE`
- `DROP TABLESPACE`
- `SET search_path TO <SCHEMA>`

### Connection limits

- SQL over HTTP to a shared cluster has rate limits in place. SQL over HTTP to a [dedicated cluster](/docs/dedicated-cluster) does not have rate limits in place.
- Shared cluster - TODO, amount of available connections
- [Dedicated cluster](/docs/dedicated-cluster) - no limit to connections

### `xata_` Column prefix

Xata reserves the `xata_` column prefix for [special columns](docs/concepts/data-model#special-columns) and rejects any custom created columns with the prefix.

## sslmode

Xata does not allow plain text connections, this may have an effect on the client you are using and the default that is inferred by such.
If you face an issue with an error message as shown below, you will need to explicitly force SSL, by adding the sslmode to `require` in the connection string or pass in a parameterized way depending on the tool you are using.

```bash
psql: error: connection to server at "eu-west-1.sql.xata.sh" (42.42.42.42), port 5432 failed: SSL required
```

Xata recommends that the client verifies the server certificate, in psql this would be achieved with the `verify-ca` and `verify-full` modes.

<Alert status="warning">TODO: add screenshot and or more detail how to get the certificate.</Alert>

We will need to provide a certificate store to do this, it is usually present in most operative systems, for instance:

MacOS: `/etc/ssl/cert.pem`
GNU/Linux: `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`

Using psql on Mac to establish a fully secure connection to Xata is as easy as:

```bash
psql "sslmode=verify-full sslrootcert=/etc/ssl/cert.pem user=ws1234 password=xau_apikey123456 host=us-east-1.sql.xata.sh dbname=Games:main"
```

Keep in mind that different clients will provide different configuration options.
Please refer to the main Postgres documentation for more in depth information about the [sslmodes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html) option.
