Xata uses HTTP-based APIs for data management and collaboration, ensuring standardization, security, and compatibility with various client apps. Adherence to RESTful principles ensures predictable and consistent API structures for evolvability without disrupting existing applications.

> Note, Xata can support no-code or low-code data ingestion through integrations with tools like [Zapier](/docs/integrations/zapier) and [Airbyte](/docs/integrations/airbyte).

## Methods

The API methods define the actions that can be performed on resources. See our [API reference docs](/docs/api-reference/user#get-user-details) for more information.

| HTTP Method | Description                                            | Read or Write | CRUD Equivalent    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- | ------------------ |
| GET         | Retrieve data or information from a resource.          | Read          | Read               |
| POST        | Create a new resource or initiate specific actions.    | Write         | Create             |
| PATCH       | Make partial modifications to an existing resource.    | Write         | Update (_partial_) |
| PUT         | Replace an existing resource or create if not present. | Write         | Update (_full_)    |
| DELETE      | Remove a resource or data from a collection.           | Write         | Delete             |

## Responses

The responses listed below are standardized and can be applied to any API, including the Xata API. These response status codes adhere to the standards defined in [RFC 2616](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt) and [RFC 6585](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6585) for web APIs.
