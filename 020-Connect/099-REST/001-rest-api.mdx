Xata uses HTTP-based APIs for data management and collaboration, ensuring standardization, security, and compatibility with various client apps. Adherence to RESTful principles ensures predictable and consistent API structures for evolvability without disrupting existing applications.

> Note, Xata can support no-code or low-code data ingestion through integrations with tools like [Zapier](/docs/integrations/zapier) and [Airbyte](/docs/integrations/airbyte).

## OpenAPI specifications

To provide an easy way to use your favorite tools for exploring the Xata API, you can use the [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification:

- [Core API spec](https://xata.io/api/openapi?scope=core)
- [Workspace API spec](https://xata.io/api/openapi?scope=workspace)

## Methods

The API methods define the actions that can be performed on resources. See our [API reference docs](/docs/api-reference/user#get-user-details) for more information.

| HTTP Method | Description                                            | Read or Write | CRUD Equivalent    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- | ------------------ |
| GET         | Retrieve data or information from a resource.          | Read          | Read               |
| POST        | Create a new resource or initiate specific actions.    | Write         | Create             |
| PATCH       | Make partial modifications to an existing resource.    | Write         | Update (_partial_) |
| PUT         | Replace an existing resource or create if not present. | Write         | Update (_full_)    |
| DELETE      | Remove a resource or data from a collection.           | Write         | Delete             |

## Responses

The responses listed below are standardized and can be applied to any API, including the Xata API. These response status codes adhere to the standards defined in [RFC 2616](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt) and [RFC 6585](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6585) for web APIs.

| Status code | Meaning                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Authentication

The Xata API uses API keys to authenticate users, ensuring secure interactions with the database.

To access Xata via the API, authentication is required using an API key associated with the workspace. Client libraries like TypeScript or Python include this key in the "Authorization" header when emitting HTTPS requests to Xata. If you're using tools like cURL to make HTTPS requests directly, you'll need to include the API key in the "Authorization" HTTP request header.

## Generate an API key

You can use a personal API key to log in to the Xata CLI client, granting you access to your workspaces and databases.

To create an API key, visit the [Account Settings](https://app.xata.io/settings) page and click **+ Add a key**. You'll be prompted to enter a name for your key, then click **Save**. Upon regenerating a key, the previous key instance becomes invalid immediately. You need to update the API key value with the new value in every place where it is used.

## Find your API key

All the API keys you generate are listed in the "Personal API Keys" section of your [Account Settings](https://app.xata.io/settings).

## Regenerate an API key

For security and access control reasons, it's important to regenerate your API key if you have any concerns about its security. Do not share or disclose your API key under any circumstances. If you suspect that your key's security has been compromised, take action by clicking **Regenerate** to update it.

## Send an authenticated request

After you have an API key, you're ready to interact with any route on our [API reference](/docs/api-reference/user), passing the key in the request's `Authorization` header. For example, to get a list of your workspaces, you can make a request like the following:

<TabbedCode tabs={['TypeScript', 'Python', 'cURL']}>

```ts
import fetch from 'node-fetch';
fetch('https://api.xata.io/workspaces', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY', // <- the magic
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((workspaces) => console.log('Look ma! Workspaces!', workspaces));
```

```python
from requests import request
headers = {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
}
resp = request("GET", "https://api.xata.io/workspaces", headers=headers)
print(resp.json())
```

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.xata.io/workspaces \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

</TabbedCode>

> Note that we `import fetch from "node-fetch"` because **we recommend interacting with the Xata API from a backend** that serves as a proxy to our API. This protects your API key by not exposing it to a browser environment. When `fetch` is called in a browser, all headers sent with the request [are visible in a browser's developer tools](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4423061/how-can-i-view-http-headers-in-google-chrome), which has severe security implications. This visibility can have serious security consequences, as it may lead to the unintended exposure of your API key, potentially putting your database at risk of security threats.

## Contexts

Most Xata API operations occur within the context of a _workspace_, which can be thought of as a "organization" in which all of your databases live. Some things though, are not _part_ of a workspace, but adjacent to workspaces&mdash;like _other workspaces_. Because of this, Xata offers different API hosts depending on your usage contexts. We explain this more in the following sections.

### Core API

The Core API is accessible at the origin `https://api.xata.io` and is responsible for operations on all Xata properties that are not bound to a specific workspace. These include:

- `/user`: Since one user can belong to multiple workspaces, a `user` is not bound to a workspace.
- `/workspaces`: A workspace is equivalent to an organization or team, and cannot be a child of another workspace. Workspaces are top-level entities, so workspaces are managed with the Core API.

Everything else that falls under the context of a workspace is operable with Xata's workspace-bound APIs.

### Workspace API

Bound by the [REST API limits](/docs/rest-api/limits), each workspace in Xata can contain a number of databases and each database can have a number of tables and branches . When interacting with Xata properties within the bounds of a workspace, we use the workspace-level API. This is accessible at a domain that is visible to you in your workspace's management section.

For example, the general form of the database API is:

```text
https://{workspace-display-name}-{workspace-id}.{region}.xata.sh/db/{dbname}
```

An example of this is:

```text
https://my-workspace-123456.us-east-1.xata.sh/db/yourdatabase
```

In the above:

- `{workspace-display-name}` is the display name of the workspace and is used to make identifying the workspace easier. It is ignored by the API.
- `{workspace-id}` is the unique ID of the workspace, currently consisting of 6 alphanumeric characters.
- `{region}` is the region in which the database is hosted. Note that the region can be configured per database, and this value must match the database region configuration.
- `{dbname}` is the name of the database you are interacting with.

You can find your workspace domain by navigating to the **Configuration** tab in the Xata Web UI, or in the **Get Code Snippet** under **Set up Xata Project**.
