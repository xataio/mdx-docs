The [pg8000](https://pypi.org/project/pg8000/) driver comes with different API'satisfies, the [Database API v2.0](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/) and the pg8000 native one.
Both API's use the parameterized approach to define the connection parameters.
Please replace the placeholders in the connection string or parameters, as indicated on the [connect to Postgres](/docs/postgres) page.

pg8000 does not default to encrypted connections out of the box, and as Xata rejects all [not encyrpted connections](/docs/postgres#sslmode), you need to specify the SSL context.
This is done by adding the `ssl_context=True` in the connection parameters.
The following examples both demonstrate this.

## Database API v2.0

```python
import pg8000.dbapi

con = pg8000.dbapi.Connection(
  database="<DATABASE_NAME>:<BRANCH>",
  user="<WORKSPACE_ID>",
  password="<API_KEY>",
  host="<REGION>.sql.xata.sh",
  port=5432,
  ssl_context=True, # sslmode=require
)
cursor = con.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT 1")
print(cursor.fetchone())
# [1]
con.close()
```

## Native

```python
import pg8000.native

con = pg8000.native.Connection(
  database="<DATABASE_NAME>:<BRANCH>",
  user="<WORKSPACE_ID>",
  password="<API_KEY>",
  host="<REGION>.sql.xata.sh",
  port=5432,
  ssl_context=True, # sslmode=require
)
res = con.run("SELECT 1")
print(res)
# [[1]]
con.close()
```
