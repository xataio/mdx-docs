Xata uses PostgreSQL under the hood to store your data. You can work
with your data using the well-known SQL and get the results in a
regular Xata JSON response over HTTP. When the Xata API does not
support the query you need, you can access SQL directly to perform
query, insert, update and delete records as you wish.

Xata supports a subset of PostgreSQL language and functions.
Supported functions include subquery, comparison, aggregate, window,
range, json, string, datetime and array functions. All other functions
are forbidden.

## Data model

Database tables are stored in PostgreSQL as tables. Xata datatypes
are mapped to PostgreSQL types with additional constraints.

| Xata datatype | PostgreSQL datatype | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ----- |
| string | text | |
| text | text | with constaint on maximum length |
| int | bigint | |
| float | double precision | |
| datetime | timestamptz | |
| bool | boolean | |
| email | text | validated by Xata |
| multiple | text[] | validated by Xata |
| file | jsonb | validated by Xata |
| filearray | jsonb | validated by Xata |
| link | foreign key | |

Database tables are stored in PostgreSQL. Linked columns are foreign
keys pointing to the linked table. If you want to access a linked
column, use JOINs or WHERE conditions to find the corresponding
records.  Example: `SELECT "Users".email, address.city FROM "Users"
LEFT JOIN address ON "Users".id=address.id `.

Other special Xata datatypes like `email` require you to insert it
using the Xata API or SDK, otherwise Xata cannot check if the data
inserted is valid or not. Thus, we suggest you do not write such
column directly. Instead use the API we provide.

### Table and column names

Please note when you are working with names that include upper-case
letters like `Users` or `zipCode`, you must quote those
otherwise PostgreSQL treats it as a lowercase name.
`POST https://{your-workspace-slug}.{region}.xata.sh/db/db_branch_name/sql`

## Endpoint

Available parameters:

* `query`: required, your SQL statement.
* `params`: list of parameters when submitting a parameterized query.
*  `consistency`:  consistency  when   executing  a  query.  Available options: `strong`, `eventual`. Default: `strong`.

## Examples

### Fetch all records

<TabbedCode tabs={['TypeScript', 'Python', 'JSON']}>
```ts
const { records: myRecord } = await xata.sql<TeamsRecord>`SELECT * FROM teams`;
```
```python
records = xata.sql().query("SELECT * FROM \"teams\"")
```
```json
{
  "query": "SELECT * FROM \"teams\""
}
```
</TabbedCode>

The following response is returned:

```json
{
  "records": [
    {
      "id": "rec_c8hng2h26un90p8sr7k0",
      "name": "Matrix",
      "owner": {
        "id": "myid"
      },
      "xata": {
        "version": 0,
        "createdAt": "2023-05-15T08:21:31.96526+01:00",
        "updatedAt": "2023-05-15T21:58:54.072595+01:00"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Select a subset of columns from your table

<TabbedCode tabs={['TypeScript', 'Python', 'JSON']}>
```ts
const { records: myRecord } = await xata.sql<TeamsRecord>`SELECT name, city FROM "Users"`;
```
```python
records = xata.sql().query("SELECT name, city FROM \"Users\"")
```
```json
{
  "query": "SELECT name, city FROM \"Users\""
}
```
</TabbedCode>

Response:

```json
{
  "records": [
    {
      "city": "New York",
    	"name": "Keanu Reaves"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Insert a new record using a parameterized query

<TabbedCode tabs={['TypeScript', 'Python', 'JSON']}>
```ts
const { records: myRecord } = await xata.sql<TeamsRecord>`INSERT INTO "Users" (name, email) VALUES ($1, $2)`;
```
```python
records = xata.sql().query(
  "INSERT INTO \"Users\" (name, email) VALUES ($1, $2)",
  ["Keanu Reeves", "keanu@example.com"]
)
```
```json
{
  "query": "INSERT INTO \"Users\" (name, email) VALUES ($1, $2)",
  "params": ["Keanu Reeves", "keanu@example.com"]
}
```
</TabbedCode>

### Delete record using a parameterized query

```json
  ```json
  {
	"query": "DELETE FROM  \"Users\" WHERE id=$1",
	"params": ["my-record-id"]
  }
  ```
```


## Limitations

* `xata.*` internal fields are read-only.
* You can only submit one statement per request.
* Xata returns 1000 records at a time. Please access your data using `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` keywords to iterate over your data.
* `CASE` keyword is not supported.
* JSON formatter functions do not work as the endpoint already returns a JSON response.
* Columns with the same name are overwritten by default. If you have multiple columns with the same name please use aliasing to rename at least one of them. For example: `SELECT address AS physical_address, address AS email FROM people, emails WHERE people.id=emails.id;`
* Xata does not support DDL commands like CREATE, DROP, ALTER and TRUNCATE.
* Xata does not support DCL commands like GRANT or REVOKE.
* Xata does not support TCL commands like COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT, etc.
