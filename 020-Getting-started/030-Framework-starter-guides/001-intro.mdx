The getting started with Xata guides for Astro, Next.js, Nuxt, Remix, SolidStart, and SvelteKit walk you through building a blog application and, in doing so, help you learn some Xata fundamentals.

## What will you learn?

The guides demonstrate features such as:

- Using the Xata CLI to create a database
- Defining a database schema and seeding the database by importing a CSV
- TypeScript code generation with database branching
- Querying and filtering
- Full-text fuzzy search
- The guides also cover some specific framework features and how those work with Xata.
