TODO: intro text

Currently, usage is only visible up to the workspace level, but we are working on making this feature available down to the database level in the [pro plan](/docs/concepts/pricing#pro-plan).

The following metrics are covered:

- Data storage
- Search storage
- File storage
- AI questions asked
- Total number of branches

We will continuously release more metrics over time.
