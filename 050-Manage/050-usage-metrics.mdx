TODO: intro text

Currently, usage is only visible up to the workspace level, but we are working on making this feature available down to the database level in the [pro plan](/docs/concepts/pricing#pro-plan).

The following metrics are covered:

- Data storage
- Search storage
- File storage
- AI questions asked
- Total number of branches

We will contiously release more metrics more metrics over time.

As a [pro plan](/docs/concepts/pricing#pro-plan) user, Xata provides granular insights over different timespans.
Your current billing period, the previous one or 7, 14 and 30 days are options.

As [free plan](/docs/concepts/pricing#free-plan) user, you only get limited insights into usage.
The displayed metrics are purposed to provide you a concise picture of consumed resources within the [limits of the free tier](/docs/concepts/pricing#pricing-plans).
