TODO: intro text

Currently, usage is only visible up to the workspace level, but we are working on making this feature available down to the database level in the [pro plan](/docs/concepts/pricing#pro-plan).

The following metrics are covered:

- Data storage: The storage on disk all databases in your workspace consume.
- Search storage: The storage on disk dedicated to the search and analytics engine. The search feature can be disabled in your database settings if you don't plan on using it.
- File storage: The storage on disk your file attachments consume.
- AI questions: The number of questions asked to the `ask` endpoint. AI questions are an opt-in integration with OpenAI and ChatGPT.
- Total branches: The total number of of database branches in your workspace.

We will continuously release more metrics over time.
