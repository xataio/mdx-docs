Xata runs migrations on your database branch anytime the schema is changed. You can find a log of these changes within the UI on the <strong>Schema history</strong> page. The [CLI]() provides commands to `push` and `pull` these updates to and from remote to your local project. The files generated live in the `.xata` folder and can and should be committed with your source code.

- The `xata pull [branch]` command pulls migrations from your branch and updates the `.ledger` file. It will also run any optional `codegen` (ex: TypeScript types) provided by your SDK of choice.
- The `xata push [branch]` command pushes your migrations to a defined branch.

Each migration file holds a JSON object containing the migration record, and list of operations. The file structure for beta [Postgres enabled](/docs/postgres) projects utilize [pgroll](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll) migration formats. Generally speaking you should not need to worry about these files unless you plan to build automation tools around migrations. For example our [PR based workflow](/docs/getting-started/workflow) uses these files to perform migrations on PR merges.

Migration files should not be modified. If modified, the record may become invalid. Xata keeps track of all migrations within a database and attempting to push a modified migration file to another branch will result in an error.

Migrations must be ordered. Ordering is guaranteed by the `parent` and the ledger file, which is stored in `.xata/migrations/.ledger`. The ledger file is an append only file that lists all migration files in the correct order.
