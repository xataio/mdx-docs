Xata provides you multiple options to interact with your database, the most powerful is the dedicated cluster.
It is a Postgres instance, that only belongs to you, so you get all the power of Postgres with Xata features on top.

Dedicated cluster is available in the [Pro plan](/docs/concepts/pricing#pro-plan).

## Supported versions

At the moment Xata supports the following Postgres versions:

- 15.4
- 15.5
- 14.10

Another functionality we are working on is to provide you control over the maintenance windows and the ability upgrade a version yourself.
