## Why this message occurred

Our SDK detected that you are using a Xata API key in a browser (Example API key: `xau_xyz123`).

## How to fix this

**✅ Only use Xata API keys in server-side code.**

In some frameworks (e.g. Next.js) it can be unclear which code is server-side and which is client-side. If in doubt, try using the Xata SDK inside an API route.

## Why can't I use Xata API keys in a browser?

⚠️ Xata API Keys have unrestricted permissions in your Xata database.

Xata API keys can:

- Delete databases
- read/write to all tables
