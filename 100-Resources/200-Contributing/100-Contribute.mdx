### Issues and labels

To help you get started, we have labeled issues as "**good first issue**" for newcomers and "**help wanted**" for tasks of varying complexity. These labels serve as guides to find suitable tasks. Comment on any issue that is of interest and contact us on Discord to learn more about the context.

### Report bugs

Bug reports help us enhance the platform and are greatly appreciated. If you encounter any issues, report them by opening new issues on GitHub or contacting us on Discord.

- **If you're a developer:** Use our contributing guide for developers to start. It provides information on setting up the development environment, coding standards, and the contribution process.
- **If you're interested in writing documentation:** Explore our documentation guidelines. These guidelines ensure that your documentation contributions align with our standards.

### OpenAPI specification

Our API is defined via [OpenAPI specifications](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification). For a comprehensive understanding and further details on these specifications, refer to our [documentation](/docs/rest-api/contexts).
You can pull the [OpenAPI specifications](/docs/rest-api/contexts#openapi-specifications) or navigate to the [REST API](/docs/api-reference/user#get-user-details) for more information.

To get started working with the API, familiarize yourself with the [API documentation](). Set up authentication to securly make API requests. You can start with a simple `GET` request to test it. For example:

```sh
curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/workspaces" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

- Replace the URL and `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your actual details.

To make a request, verify your setup by fetching workspaces with the authenticated `GET` request. This ensures your authentication method is correctly configured.

After the initial request, explore more complex API functionalities as detailed in our [documentation](/docs/api-reference/user#get-user-details), including endpoints for user details and other operations.

For exploration of the Xata API with your preferred tools, see our [documentation](/docs/rest-api/contexts#openapi-specifications) on OpenAPI specifications.
