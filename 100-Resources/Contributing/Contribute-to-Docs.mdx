This guide is for anyone interested in improving existing Xata docs or creating new info.

Xata's developer documentation follows a [docs-as-code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) approach, where documentation is crafted using tools similar to code development. To contribute, you can suggest changes by forking the documentation GitHub repositories and [creating pull requests (PRs)](https://docs-template.consensys.io/contribute/submit-a-contribution). This collaborative process allows for open contributions, testing, and review of the documentation.

> Note: Basic Git, GitHub, and Markdown knowledge is assumed. The documentation site is hosted on Vercel, uses MDX syntax, and has heavy use of linters such as ES linter, prettier, and remark.

## Submit a docs PR

1.  Fork the `mdx-docs` repository on GitHub to create your copy.

2.  Clone your forked repository to your local machine using Git.

3.  Create a new branch for your changes: git checkout -b my-docs-update.

4.  Make the necessary changes to the documentation files using a Markdown editor.

5.  Add and commit your changes: git add . and git commit -m "Update documentation".

6.  Push the changes to your forked repository: git push origin my-docs-update.

7.  Go to the mdx-docs repository on GitHub and create a new pull request from your branch.

8.  Provide a clear title and description for your PR, explaining the purpose of your changes.

9.  Submit the PR, and it will be reviewed by the Xata team.

10. Make any requested changes during the review process and collaborate until your PR is approved.

11. Once the PR meets all requirements and is approved by the team, it is merged into the `main` branch, and the changes become part of the official Xata documentation.

## Linting

Linting rules are enforced to ensure consistency and readability across the codebase. The docs use ESLint, Prettier, and Remark for linting. These tools are essential for keeping the code clean and consistent.

Contributors are advised to run pnpm install in their local development environment. This step ensures that all necessary linting packages are installed and configured, allowing for real-time linting error detection.

### Troubleshooting linting issues

## Style guide

### MDX syntax

Titles should be descriptive but not to long. Aim for titles between 3-8 words long and have less than 50 characters.

##### Admonition

Admonitions serve as cues to direct the reader's attention towards specific information. It's advisable to use admonitions sparingly and avoid clustering multiple admonitions closely together. If you find the need for multiple admonitions, consider reorganizing the content by integrating less critical points into the main narrative.

Here are the accepted types of admonitions:

NOTE: This provides extra guidance or advice to enhance product setup, performance, or supportability.

IMPORTANT: It conveys advisory details crucial for task completion, and users should pay close attention.

WARNING: This communicates potential risks such as system damage, data loss, or support-related issues if the reader ignores the admonition. It includes an explanation of the problem, its cause, and a viable solution. If possible, it offers preventive measures or directs users to additional resources.

TIP: This suggests alternative approaches that may not be immediately apparent. It simplifies the application of described techniques and procedures, catering to specific requirements. While beneficial for users' understanding of the product's capabilities, it's not essential for product usage.
