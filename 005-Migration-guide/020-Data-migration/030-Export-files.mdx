To export all files from a Xata Lite database, you can clone our [Export Files from Xata Lite](https://github.com/xataio/Export-Files-from-a-Xata-Lite-Database) GitHub repository and follow the steps in the README. 

Note that which script you use to export the files will depend on whether or not your database has Postgres direct access enabled. You can know if your database has Postgres direct access enabled if it has a Postgres endpoint. See the Database settings.
