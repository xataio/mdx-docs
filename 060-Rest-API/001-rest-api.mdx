Xata uses HTTP-based APIs for data management and collaboration, ensuring standardization, security, and compatibility with various client apps. Adherence to RESTful principles ensures predictable and consistent API structures for evolvability without disrupting existing applications. Note that Xata can support no-code or low-code data ingestion through integrations with tools like [Zapier](/docs/integrations/zapier) and [Airbyte](/docs/integrations/airbyte).
