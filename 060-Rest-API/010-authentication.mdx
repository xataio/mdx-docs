The Xata API uses API keys to authenticate users, ensuring secure interactions with the database.

To access Xata via the API, authentication is required using an API key associated with the workspace. For client libraries like TypeScript or Python, or if you're using tools like cURL to make HTTP requests directly, you'll need to include the API key in the HTTP request header.

## Generate an API key

You can use a personal API key to log in to the Xata CLI client, granting you access to your workspaces and databases.

To create an API key, visit the [Account Settings](https://app.xata.io/settings) page and click **+ Add a key**. You'll be prompted to enter a name for your key, then click **Save**.

## Find your API key

All the API keys you generate are listed in the "Personal API Keys" section of your [Account Settings](https://app.xata.io/settings).

## Regenerate an API key

For security and access control reasons, it's important to regenerate your API key if you have any concerns about its security. Do not share or disclose your API key under any circumstances. If you suspect that your key's security has been compromised, take action by clicking **Regenerate** to update it.

## Send an authenticated request

After you have an API key, you're ready to interact with any route on our [API reference](/docs/api-reference/user), passing the key in the request's `Authorization` header. For example, to get a list of your workspaces, you can make a request like the following:

<TabbedCode tabs={['TypeScript', 'Python', 'cURL']}>
```ts
import fetch from 'node-fetch'
fetch('https://api.xata.io/workspaces', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY', // <- the magic
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
})
.then((response) => response.json())
.then((workspaces) => console.log('Look ma! Workspaces!', workspaces))
```
```python
from requests import request
headers = {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
}
resp = request("GET", "https://api.xata.io/workspaces", headers=headers)
print(resp.json())
```
```bash
curl -X GET https://api.xata.io/workspaces \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
</TabbedCode>

> Note that we `import fetch from "node-fetch"` because **we recommend interacting with the Xata API from a backend** that serves as a proxy to our API. This protects your API key by not exposing it to a browser environment. When `fetch` is called in a browser, all headers sent with the request [are visible in a browser's developer tools](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4423061/how-can-i-view-http-headers-in-google-chrome), which raises security concerns.
