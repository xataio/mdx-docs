To provide an easy way to use your favorite tools for exploring the Xata API, you can use the [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification:

[Workspace API spec](https://xata.io/api/openapi?scope=workspace)

### OpenAPI Codegen

With [OpenAPI Codegen](https://github.com/fabien0102/openapi-codegen) you an generate TypeScript fetcher functions or typed react-query hooks from your OpenAPI schema.

> ⚠️ Using generated react-query components in this context will leak your API key! The REST API must always be called in a server-side environment!
