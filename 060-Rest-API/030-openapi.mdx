To provide an easy way to use your favorite tools for exploring the Xata API, you can use the [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification:

The base url is `https://api.xata.io` and this give you to access to the core API.

[Workspace API spec](https://xata.io/api/openapi?scope=workspace)

### [OpenAPI Codegen](https://github.com/fabien0102/openapi-codegen)

Generate TypeScript fetcher functions or typed react-query hooks from your OpenAPI schema.

> ⚠️ Using generated react-query components in this context will leak your API key! The REST API must always be called in a server-side environment!
