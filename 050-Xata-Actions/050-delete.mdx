To delete a record you can execute, for example:

<TabbedCode tabs={['TypeScript', 'Python', 'JSON']}>

```ts
const user = await xata.db.Users.delete('rec_cd8s3r8avc42pi67m13g');

// or, using the delete method on the record object:
user.delete();
```

```python
user = xata.records().delete("Users", "rec_cd8s3r8avc42pi67m13g")
```

```jsonc
// DELETE https://{workspace}.{region}.xata.sh/db/{db}:{branch}/tables/{table}/data/{record_id}
```

</TabbedCode>

In case the record with the given ID doesn't exist, the REST API returns a 404 and the TypeScript SDK throws an exception.

Transactions are used when deleting multiple records:

<TabbedCode tabs={['TypeScript', 'Python', 'JSON']}>

```ts
const users = await xata.db.Users.delete(['rec_cd8s3r8avc42pi67m13g', 'rec_cgh9o1oncchhigq95n2g']);
```

```python
users = xata.records().transaction({
  "operations": [
    {
      "delete": {
        "table": "Users",
        "id": "rec_cd8s3r8avc42pi67m13g"
      }
    },
    {
      "delete": {
        "table": "Users",
        "id": "rec_cgh9o1oncchhigq95n2g"
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

```jsonc
// POST https://{workspace}.{region}.xata.sh/db/{db}:{branch}/transaction
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "delete": {
        "table": "Users",
        "id": "rec_cd8s3r8avc42pi67m13g"
      }
    },
    {
      "delete": {
        "table": "Users",
        "id": "rec_cgh9o1oncchhigq95n2g"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

</TabbedCode>

[Transactions](/docs/typescript-client/transaction) will not fail a delete operation if no record is found. All operations in a transaction must succeed otherwise it is rolled back.

## Next Steps

Now that you have seen how to do the basic create, remove, update, and delete operations, you can check out the docs on using the [free text search API](/docs/typescript-client/search), which is a new super power that Xata gives you.

You can also review the pages on [getting data](/docs/typescript-client/get), [updating data](/docs/typescript-client/update), [inserting data](/docs/typescript-client/insert). We've got guides for each of these operations.
