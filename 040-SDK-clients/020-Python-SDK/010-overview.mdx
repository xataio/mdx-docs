The Python SDK is available as a [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/xata/)

<Alert status="warning">
  This SDK is in active development and is not yet ready for production use, subscribe to [this GitHub
  ticket](https://github.com/xataio/xata-py/issues/24) to get updates on the road to GA.
</Alert>

The Python SDK uses type annotations and requires Python 3.8 or higher. You can read more about the Python SDK in its [API reference](https://xata-py.readthedocs.io).

## Installation

To install the library:

```bash
pip install xata
```

The xata package is a standalone SDK library that features the `XataClient`. By installing the package, you can import the SDK into your Python project and start building on top of Xata. Please note, that the Python SDK is different from the [Xata CLI](/docs/getting-started/installation#install-the-xata-cli) which can be used to manage your Xata databases from the command line or to import the [Typescript and Javascript client](/docs/typescript-client/overview).

## Configuration

### Workspace URL

To bootstrap the SDK we advise to use the workspace URL. In the [Web UI](https://app.xata.io), please navigate to _Workspaces_ then _Configuration_ and you will see the workspace API base URL. Please copy the URL and use it to setup routing.

The URL can be passed to the client as parameter:

```py
xata = XataClient(db_url="REDACTED_DB_URL")
```

Or you can set the environment variable: `XATA_DATABASE_URL`. The parameter value will take precedence over the environment variable.

The format of the database URL (`db_url`) parameter must follow the format of: `https://test-123456.us-east-1.xata.sh/db/mydb`. The branch name is not mandatory, it can be either appended to the URL, with a `:` as the separator, like this `https://test-123456.us-east-1.xata.sh/db/mydb:my-feature-branch`. Alternatively, you can specify the `branch_name` with the parameter in `XataClient`.

### Authorization

There are multiple options to pass your Xata credentials to the client. Xata will check following this order of precedence:

1. Parameters passed to the constructor
1. Environment variables
1. The `.env` file
1. Via `.xatarc` configuration file

The `.xatarc` file is generated by the [Xata CLI](/docs/getting-started/installation#install-the-xata-cli) in the current directory when running the command `xata init`.

#### dotenv

If the previous options were empty, the client looks for a `.env` file in the project root directory. Visit the [Authentication][0] page to read more about best practices.

```bash
XATA_API_KEY="REDACTED_API_KEY"
XATA_DATABASE_URL="REDACTED_DB_URL"
```

#### xatarc configuration file

The `.xatarc` configuration file is the final source to retrieve the API key and the workspace.
Please refer to the [authentication][0] page to learn more about the `.xatarc` file and best practices.

#### Environment Variables

If no parameters were passed, the client probes the following environment variables for authentication.

```bash
export XATA_API_KEY="REDACTED_API_KEY"
export XATA_DATABASE_URL="REDACTED_DB_URL"
```

```python
from xata.client import XataClient

client = XataClient()
```

#### Parameters

Inject the API key and workspace `id` directly into the constructor as parameters:

```python
from xata.client import XataClient

client = XataClient(api_key="REDACTED_API_KEY", db_url="REDACTED_DB_URL")
```

## Logging

The SDK builds on the [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) package and includes built-in logging support. By configuring the log level to DEBUG, you can view the URL and status code by default.
