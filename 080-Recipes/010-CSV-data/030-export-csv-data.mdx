## Export data

To download your table as a `.csv` file, click **Action** next to your table name:

![Export CSV data table](../images/export-table.png)

You can choose to download your table from the drop-down list.

There are two options for downloading a CSV file:

#### Export full table to CSV

This action generates a CSV file of all rows contained within your table. This is valuable for generating backups, transferring data to alternative systems, or importing data into another Xata table.

#### Export current view to CSV

This action generates a CSV file that copies your present table view, including all filters, columns, and sorting preferences. This is particularly useful for data sharing purposes or importing a specific subset of rows into a spreadsheet for analysis.
