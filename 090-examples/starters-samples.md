# Xata Examples

This section contains a list of example usages of Xata. We've got a few examples that demonstrate how to use Xata with different frameworks and libraries. We also have a few examples that demonstrate how to use Xata with different services. There are a few different kinds of examples:

## Samples

Samples demonstrate _how to implement_ certain functionality with Xata, from user authentication to image and file uploads and storage. They are intended to serve as a guide for how to solve a specific problem when working with Xata.

These are often prefixed with `sample-`. An example of a sample, can be seen in our examples GitHub repository:

- [Xata with Basic Auth](https://github.com/xataio/examples/tree/main/apps/sample-nextjs-basic-auth)

## Starters

Starter applications on Xata are minimal, cloneable, forkable GitHub repositories that are intended to serve as a starting point for your applications on Xata. Each starter comes with a README that explains how to get started with the application, and bundles together a predetermined choice of technologies. You can use the starter as-is, or fork it and customize it to your needs.

Here are some of the starters that are available:

- [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-xata)
- [Remix + Netlify](https://github.com/xataio/examples/tree/main/apps/starter-remix-netlify)
- [Vercel Serverless Functions](https://github.com/xataio/examples/tree/main/apps/starter-vercel-serverless-functions)

For an exhaustive list of both, please refer to our [examples repository on GitHub](https://github.com/xataio/examples/tree/main/apps).
