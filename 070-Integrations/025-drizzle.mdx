  The integration of Drizzle with Xata is currently in an experimental phase and is not yet fully supported.

[Drizzle](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm) is a TypeScript ORM that is focused on type safety and follows closely follows the SQL syntax. 

You can use Drizzle with a Xata, as demonstrated in the following examples:

 ```tsx
 import { pgTable, text } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';
 import { drizzle } from '@xata.io/drizzle';
 import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm';
 import { getXataClient } from './xata';

 const xata = getXataClient();
 const db = drizzle(xata);

 const drivers = pgTable('drivers', {
   id: text('id').primaryKey(),
   surname: text('surname'),
   forename: text('forename')
 });

 const result = await db.select(['forename', 'surname']).from(drivers).where(eq('nationality', 'spanish')).execute();
 ```

 Currently, we recommend manually defining the schema like in the example above. We are working on utility functions to automatically generate the Drizzle model from the Xata database schema.
