[Drizzle](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm) is a TypeScript ORM that is focused on type safety and closely follows the SQL syntax. 


### Usage 

You can use Drizzle with a Xata, as demonstrated in the following examples:

 ```tsx
 import { pgTable, text } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';
 import { drizzle } from '@xata.io/drizzle';
 import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm';
 import { getXataClient } from './xata';

const xata = getXataClient();

const drivers = pgTable("drivers", {
  id: text("id").primaryKey(),
  surname: text("surname"),
  forename: text("forename"),
  nationality: text("nationality"),
});

const db = drizzle(xata);

const result = await db
  .select({ surname: drivers.surname, forename: drivers.forename })
  .from(drivers)
  .where(eq(drivers.nationality, "Spanish"))
  .execute();
 ```
The code imports required modules from the `drizzle-orm` and `@xata.io/drizzle` libraries. It also brings in the `eq` function from `drizzle-orm` for value comparison and the `getXataClient` function from a local xata module. The `getXataClient` function is used to acquire an instance of the Xata client.

Currently, we recommend manually defining the schema like in the example above. We are working on utility functions to automatically generate the Drizzle model from the Xata database schema.
