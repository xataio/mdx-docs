[Kysely](https://kysely.dev/docs/intro) is a TypeScript SQL query builder. It focuses on ensuring type safety and autocompletion and works with a growing number of database services. Kysely works in any JavaScript runtime, including Node.js, Cloudflare Workers, and Deno.

While the native Xata TypeScript SDK offers similar built-in functionality, using Kysely might be preferable if you are migrating from another database service, or if you are already using Kysely in your project.

This integration consists of a [Xata dialect for Kysely](https://github.com/xataio/client-ts/tree/main/packages/plugin-client-kysely).

### Installation

Install both Kysely and `@xata.io/kysely` with the Xata client. You can use the following package managers:

<TabbedCode tabs={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>
```sh
npm install kysely @xata.io/kysely @xata.io/client
```

```sh
pnpm add kysely @xata.io/kysely @xata.io/client
```

```sh
yarn add kysely @xata.io/kysely @xata.io/client
```

</TabbedCode>

### Usage

Kysely is a query builder library for TypeScript that helps in generating SQL queries. For compatibility with Xata, a specialized dialect has been developed for Kysely. The [Xata dialect for Kysely](https://github.com/xataio/client-ts/tree/main/packages/plugin-client-kysely) enables the use of Xata-specific functionality with Kysely.

The following example, demonstrates how you can employ the Xata dialect for Kysely:

```ts
import { Kysely } from 'kysely';
import { XataDialect, Model } from '@xata.io/kysely';
import { DatabaseSchema, getXataClient } from 'xata'; // Generated client

const xata = getXataClient();

const db = new Kysely<Model<DatabaseSchema>>({
  dialect: new XataDialect({ xata })
});

const drivers = await db
  .selectFrom('drivers')
  .select(['forename', 'surname'])
  .where('nationality', '=', 'Spanish')
  .execute();
```

In the provided code example, the following steps are taken to integrate Xata with Kysely:

1. Install the Xata client as usual. See our [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started/installation) for more information.
1. Import `getXataClient` from the generated client (usually generated by `xata pull` in a file of your project).
1. Instantiate Kysely with the Xata dialect. Note that the `Model` type adapts the Xata generated `DatabaseSchema` type to a `Model` compatible with Kysely.
1. Use Kysely as you would normally, for type safety and autocompletion.
