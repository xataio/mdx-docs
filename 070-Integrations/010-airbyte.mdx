[Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/) is an ETL platform to connect your databases and data warehouses. Xata has [contributed](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/24192) a [Destination Connector](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/xata/) that enables you to ingest data from various sources into your Xata workspace. Under the hood, the connector leverages the [BulkProcessor](/docs/python-sdk/bulk-processor) of the [Python SDK](/docs/python-sdk/overview).

The connector operates in upsert mode, if a record does not have a property `id`, then the record is created otherwise the record is overwritten.

## Getting Started

You need to have an Airbyte instance running either [self-hosted](https://docs.airbyte.com/deploying-airbyte/local-deployment/), or [Airbyte Cloud](https://airbyte.com/airbyte-cloud).

- `API Key`: go to your [account settings](https://app.xata.io/settings) to generate a new key.
- `Database endpoint`: navigate to the settings tab in your database and copy the "Database endpoint" from there, then add your branch to create a URL in the format: `https://{workspace}-{id}.{region}.xata.sh/db/{database}:{branchName}`.

- Please note that not all destinations are available in the free tier of Airbyte Cloud.

Next you need to create the table in Xata with the corresponding schema. Please note that databases, tables and schemas in Xata are not created by the connector, you need to take care of that before ingesting data. One important convention is used, as highlighted [here](#3-configure-the-source), that the name of a table and the dataset name in Airbyte must be same.

The following example will guide you through the steps necessary.

## Example: CSV to Xata

In this example we walk through the steps to ingest a publicly accesible CSV file into Xata. Our source is a small CSV with 50 rows of in fictive [companies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xataio/xata-py/main/examples/datasets/airbyte/companies.csv). Any resemblance to real persons or other real-life entities is purely coincidental.

```csv
id,name,address,catch_phrase,ceo,phone,email,exchange

```

### Setup Xata for the incoming data

As mentioned before, we must setup our tables for the incoming data. We assume that we have a workspace and database created. Next we must create the table to hold the data. We are using the following schema, which matches the shape of the CSV.

```json
{
  "tables": [
    {
      "name": "Companies",
      "columns": [
        {
          "name": "id",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "name": "name",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "name": "address",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "name": "catch_phrase",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "name": "ceo",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "name": "phone",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "name": "email",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "name": "exchange",
          "type": "string"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

For simplicity, the schema is publicly available and you can use our [CLI](/docs/getting-started/cli) to create the table `Companies` with the schema.

```bash
curl -XGET https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xataio/xata-py/main/examples/datasets/airbyte/schema.json > schema.json
xata schema upload schema.json
```

Navigate to your [workspace](https://app.xata.io/workspaces) to verify the applied table schema. You are ready to go to ingest data!

### Setup Airbyte connection

The next steps will walk you through how to define CSV as a source and Xata as a destination in Airbyte.

#### 1. Create a new connection

Start by creating a new connection, which is the relationship between a source and destination.

#### 2. Select a source

Set up a new source of type CSV.

![Select new File (CSV) Source](images/select-new-csv-source.png)

The illustration and the next steps assume you don't have the source created yet. If you already have a CSV source created, please skip to [step 4](#4-select-a-destination).

#### 3. Configure the source

When you configure the source you must apply the convention, that the dataset name must have the same name as the destination table in Xata. Our case, we have the table called `Companies`, therefore we must name the dataset `Companies` as well. Here is a configuration setting for the example:

- Dataset Name: `Companies`
- File Format: `csv`
- URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xataio/xata-py/main/examples/datasets/airbyte/companies.csv`

![Setup new CSV Source](images/setup-csv-source.png)

After you clicked _Set up source_, Airbyte will test if the source configuration is valid. You're all set with the source.

#### 4. Select a destination

Next you will need to set up Xata as destination. In case the connector does not show up in the destination connectors list, please be aware that connector availbility is different in the free tier of Airbyte Cloud.

![Select Xata as Destination](images/select-new-xata-destination.png)

#### 5. Configure the destination

As explained in the [getting started](#getting-started) section, you'll need the `API Key` and `Database URL` to point to your database.

![Setup Xata as Destination](images/setup-xata-destination.png)

Equivalently as the source, Airbyte will test if the destination configuration is correct.

#### 6. Create the connection

The source and destination are setup, now we can finalize the connection.

![Create connection](images/create-connection-01.png)

![Select source](images/create-connection-02.png)

Set `manual` for the _Replication frequency_ as we want to run the example only on need. For more complex scenarios please refer to Airbyte's documentation of [sync schedules](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/connections/#sync-schedules).

![Setup connection](images/create-connection-03.png)

#### 7. Synchronize

We need to manually trigger Airbyte to start the sync between source and destination.
![Sync source and destination](images/sync-01.png)

After the sync was successful, you will see the following dialog indicating the 50 records from the CSV being committed. If you need to troubleshoot, please browse the logs from the runs as error messages from Xata are propagated.

![Sync success](images/sync-02.png)

If the previous step succeeded, you should see the records in the `Companies` table.

## Getting Involved

If you want to get involved, by contributing to the [destination connector](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/tree/master/airbyte-integrations/connectors/destination-xata) or create a [source connector](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/tree/master/airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-python-http-tutorial) for Xata, please reach out to us on discord and we will assist you.
