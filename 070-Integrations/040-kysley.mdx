[Kysely](https://kysely.dev/docs/intro) is a TypeScript SQL query builder. It focuses on ensuring type safety and autocompletion and allows you to work with visible tables and columns in your queries. Kysely supports autocompletion and is compatible with Deno, Node.js and browsers.

This integration allows you to use Kysely's query building capabilities while leveraging Xata's SQL over HTTP functionality.

### Xata dialect 

Kysely is a query builder library for TypeScript that helps in generating SQL queries. For compatibility with Xata, a specialized dialect has been developed for Kysely. The [Xata dialect for Kysely](https://github.com/xataio/client-ts/tree/main/packages/plugin-client-kysely) enables the use of Xata-specific functionality with Kysely. The following example, demonstrates how you can employ the Xata dialect for Kysely:

```tsx
import { Kysely } from 'kysely';
import { XataDialect } from '@xata.io/kysely';
import { getXataClient } from 'src/xata'; // generated client

const xata = getXataClient();

const db = new Kysely<Database>({
  xata // Your Xata client instance
});

return await db.selectFrom('person').where('id', '=', id).selectAll().executeTakeFirst();
```

In the provided code example, the following steps are being taken:

1. Import the `Kysely` class from the 'kysely' library and import the `XataDialect` class from the '@xata.io/kysely' module. The XataDialect represents a specialized extension of Kysely tailored for the Xata database.
1. Assign the result of the `getXataClient` function to the variable `xata`, establishing a connection to the Xata database and enabling interaction with it.
1. Create a new instance of the `Kysely class with a specific type, denoted as Kysely<Database>. This instance acts as a query builder, and its constructor is provided with an object containing the `xata` property, linking it to the Xata database using the Xata-specific dialect.
