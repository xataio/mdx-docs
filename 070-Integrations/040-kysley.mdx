[Kysely](https://kysely.dev/docs/intro) is a TypeScript SQL query builder. It focuses on ensuring type safety and autocompletion and allows you to work with visible tables and columns in your queries. Kysely supports autocompletion and is compatible with Deno, Node.js and browsers.

This integration allows you to use Kysely's query building capabilities while leveraging Xata's SQL over HTTP functionality.
