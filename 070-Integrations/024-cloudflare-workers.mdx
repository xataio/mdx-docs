[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/) is a content delivery network that optimizes website performance and mitigates security risks for sites. [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com) enable you to run code directly on Cloudflare's network to reduce latency and improve performance, and can be used for tasks like customizing web content, handling API requests, or modifying web traffic.

A complete [Cloudflare and Xata starter](https://github.com/xataio/examples/tree/main/apps/getting-started-cloudflare-workers) is available in the Xata `examples` repo on GitHub.

### Before you begin

- Ensure you [install the Xata CLI and authenticate](https://xata.io/docs/getting-started/installation)

- Ensure you have a [basic project with Cloudflare workers running](https://xata.io/docs/integrations/cloudflare#create-a-new-cloudflare-app-optional)

### Install the Xata client

Run the following command in the root directory of your project:

```sh
xata init
```

Accept the default settings during the configuration process. After completion, a `.env` file will be generated in your app's folder. This file includes the necessary credentials for your Cloudflare Worker to access your database. It should look like this:

```bash title=".env"
XATA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>
XATA_BRANCH=<YOUR_BRANCH_HERE>
```

A file called `.xatarc` should also be generated at the project root, with the following contents:

```json title=".xatarc"
{
  "databaseURL": <YOUR_DATABASE_URL_HERE>,
  "codegen": {
    "output": "src/xata.ts"
  }
}
```

> **Warning**: You'll need to move these vars into a file called `.dev.vars` at your project root for local development. This file enables Cloudflare to access these values when running in development mode. For more information, see [Cloudflare's documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/environment-variables/#interact-with-environment-variables-locally).

You should end up with a `.dev.vars` file that looks like this at your project root:

```bash title=".dev.vars"
XATA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>
XATA_BRANCH=<YOUR_BRANCH_HERE>
XATA_DATABASE_URL=<YOUR_DATABASE_URL_HERE>
```

### Initialize the Xata client

There are two methods for initializing the Xata client in Cloudflare Workers:

- ES modules syntax (recommended): This is the current, recommended method for apps that are being developed or maintained actively.
- Service workers syntax (deprecated): This older method is still available but not recommended for new projects.

#### ES modules syntax (recommended)

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { XataClient } from './xata';

export interface Env {
  XATA_BRANCH: string;
  XATA_API_KEY: string;
  XATA_DATABASE_URL: string;
}

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
    const xata = new XataClient({
      apiKey: env.XATA_API_KEY,
      branch: env.XATA_BRANCH,
      databaseURL: env.XATA_DATABASE_URL
    });
    // Note that the table name "Posts" may vary
    // depending on the shape of your schema
    const posts = await xata.db.Posts.getAll();
    return new Response(`Total Posts: ${posts.length}`);
  }
};
```

#### Service workers syntax (deprecated)

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { XataClient } from './xata';

async function handler(request: Request) {
  const xata = new XataClient({
    apiKey: XATA_API_KEY,
    branch: XATA_BRANCH,
    databaseURL: XATA_DATABASE_URL
  });
  // Note that the table name "Posts" may vary
  // depending on the shape of your schema
  const posts = await xata.db.Posts.getAll();
  return new Response(`Total Posts: ${posts.length}`);
}

// Initialize Worker
addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  event.respondWith(handler(event.request));
});
```

### Environment variables

Environment variables keep API keys and sensitive data safe, allowing you to easily manage and change app settings.

To add environment variables to a remotely deployed Worker, you have two options:

- Use the one-click guided workflow provided in the Cloudflare dashboard (recommended).
- Alternatively, you can set the variables manually via the Cloudflare dashboard.

#### One click guided workflow (recommended)

To integrate a Cloudflare Worker with an existing Xata database, follow these steps in the Cloudflare dashboard:

1.  Navigate to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
2.  Click **Workers & Pages** > **Overview**
3.  Choose a Worker from your Cloudflare account to integrate with.
4.  Click **Integrations**.
5.  Select the Xata card and click **Add Integration**. You're redirected to the "Add Xata to Worker" flow.

6.  Follow the flow to grant permissions, authorize Cloudflare, and configure your secrets. Choose a Xata workspace to connect with, and select the desired database and branch.
7.  Click **Add Integration**.

The secrets are added to the environment variables of the Worker. Your endpoint response should be available remotely at `<YOUR_WORKER>.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`.

#### Manually adding environment variables

Follow [Cloudflare's docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/environment-variables/#add-environment-variables-via-the-dashboard) for manually adding environment variables via the dashboard.

### Create a new Cloudflare app (optional)

<Expand title="Hello world example">

Choose the "Hello World" Worker example and accept the default prompt options.

```sh
npm create cloudflare@latest getting-started-cloudflare-workers
```

After the command has completed, navigate to the `getting-started-cloudflare-workers` directory, and run the application locally:

```sh
cd getting-started-cloudflare-workers
npm run wrangler dev
```

By default, the application runs on `http://localhost:8787`, where "Hello World" is displayed in your browser.

### Deploy your app remotely

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

Preview your Worker at `<YOUR_WORKER>.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`, where "Hello World" is displayed in the browser.
