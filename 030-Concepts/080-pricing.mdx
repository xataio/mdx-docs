Xata's pricing model is carefully designed to cater to different user needs, from individual projects to high-scale enterprise applications. For information on pricing, billing, and usage limits, you can read the docs on the is page, Ebnsiure you checkout our [pricing page](/pricing) fo rcomprehensive oversive of tthe pricing structure.

## Billing terms

### Concurrency limit

The concurrency limit refers to the cap on the number of queries that can run simultaneously. It's the cap on how many requests we process at once. Unlike a "connections limit", this doesn't count the total connections, but only the active queries. Even if a large number of connections are made, only a certain number of them can execute queries at the same time. This protects against very slow queries and ensures that extremely time-consuming queries don't stall the entire system.

To ensure optimal performance for users, we've set the following limits. These allocations are designed to prioritize and balance the workload across the different store types based on requirements and usage patterns:

  -  **Free plan:** 15 parallel requests (6 primary + 9 from replicas) to the DB
  -  **Pro plan:** 45 parallel request (18 primary + 27 from replicas) to the DB

> NOTE: These allocations are 'soft' limits. If the high usage isn't accidental or abusive, Xata can adjust these caps. Xata operates on shared clusters, and aims to ensure that one user's high usage doesn't negatively affect everyone else using that cluster.

If requests surpass the concurrency limit, they'll receive a 429 HTTP status, indicating they've been rejected due to overload.

Limits apply to each workspace and are distributed among the databases and branches within that workspace.

### Data Size

The disk's data size represents the amount of data stored in the transactional database.

This size limit is considered a soft-limit and is not strictly enforced in real-time. However, if you exceed this limit, it indicates that your data storage requirements may be approaching a critical level. In such cases, we recommend you explore potential solutions with [Xata Support](https://support.xata.io/hc/en-us) to optimize and scale your data storage.

### Rate limit

Each shared Xata instance has a set request rate limit to maintain consistent performance for all users. If requests surpass this threshold, they will return a 429 HTTP status. The following soft limits apply for rate limits in Xata

  - **Free tier:** Limited to 75 requests/second (qps).
  - **Pro tier:** Starts with a 150 requests/second (qps), which can be adjusted upon request.

Limits apply to each workspace and are distributed among the databases and branches within that workspace.

### Storage

Database storage in Xata encompasses not only disk space but also I/O rates and compute resources. The listed price per GB integrates the following three components. 

- **Storage on disk:** The actual space where your data resides. This can include database entries, files, or any other assets.

- **I/O Rates:** I/O, or Input/Output, rates determine the speed at which data can be read from or written to the storage. Higher I/O rates mean operations like reading from or saving to the database will be faster, leading to quicker response times for your apps.

- **Compute Costs**: This involves the computational resources dedicated to managing, retrieving, and manipulating stored data. This refers to having data, efficiency, and the computational power.


## Pricing plans

### Common features across all plans

All Xata plans, irrespective of their pricing, include the following features:

- **PostgreSQL database:** Xata uses Postgres, which serves as the backbone for storing structured, relational data securely. Each plan starts with 10 branches and 15 GB of storage space, but you can get more space if you need it.

- **Unlimited records:** For both plans we've dropped the limit on the number of records, so now you can have as many records as they fit in the allocated GB. This is the most significant change, and it is in the user's advantage.

- **High availability (HA):** Ensures consistent service access with minimal interruptions or downtime.

- **Elasticsearch integration:** Integrates efficient and responsive full-text search capabilities within your projects. Our search engine uses Elasticsearch, making searching a breeze because it replicates all the data from our database. You get 2 GB of space here initially, but you can buy more, or go custom, depending on what you need.

- **File attachments:** Xata uses S3 and Cloudflare's CDN for storing and delivering files. Your files are stored safely, and you access them quickly when you need them. Starting storage is 2 GB, but you can add more or customize it as per your needs.

- **Image transformations:** You can do 10k image transformations from the start and add more as needed. 

- **AI questions:** Xata offers an option for integrating with OpenAI and ChatGPT, allowing you to ask up to 250 AI-powered questions. If you want to ask more questions, you can, and yes, custom plans are available here as well.

- **Support:** Depending on your plan, you get different levels of support, starting from community support to dedicated support.

## FAQ

<Expand title="Usage limits and activity ">
##### Is there a maximum number of reads and writes per month?
No, you can serve as many reads and writes as you want within the rate limit, which is defined per second (resets every second).

##### What happens if I exceed the rate limit?
If you exceed the rate limit on Xata, you will receive a 429 HTTP status as a notification of the overload. Xata’s pricing structure is specifically tailored to cater to diverse user needs, from individual endeavors to large-scale enterprise applications. Detailed information about pricing, billing, and usage limits is available in the documentation on this page. Additionally, our [pricing page](https://xata.io/pricing) offers a thorough breakdown of our pricing model.

##### Can I increase my rate limit?
Yes, you can increase the limit by upgrading to the Pro plan, if you are on the Free plan. You can also contact us if you would like to discuss pricing options.

##### How are read and write requests measured?

##### Do the reads and writes per second differ depending on the plan chosen?

##### How is the data size measured?
We measure and determine data size by database storage, search engine storage, file attachment storage.

##### What happens when the rate limit or concurrency limits are reached?
When the rate limit or concurrency limits are reached, we will throttle your requests and  answer with a 429 status code. Your app will be in a degraded mode, but only the requests over the limit are affected. The rate limit is reset every second, and the concurrency limit is measured at any given time.
