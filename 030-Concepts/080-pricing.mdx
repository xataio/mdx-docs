For information on pricing, billing, and usage limits, refer to our [pricing page](/pricing).

### Request Rate limit

The maximum number of requests allowed per second. If the request rate limit is exceeded additional requests will fail with a `429` HTTP status.

This limit exists on shared Xata instances to ensure reliability for all users on the instance.

### Request Concurrency limit

The maximum number of simultaneous requests that can be processed at any given time.

If the request concurrency limit is exceeded additional requests will fail with a `429` HTTP status.

These allocations are designed to prioritize and balance the workload across the different store types based on requirements and usage patterns.

### Data Size

The data size on disk denotes the quantity of data held within the transactional database.

This size limit is considered a soft-limit and is not strictly enforced in real-time. However, if you exceed this limit, it indicates that your data storage requirements may be approaching a critical level. In such cases, we recommend you explore potential solutions with [Xata Support](https://support.xata.io/hc/en-us) to optimize and scale your data storage.
