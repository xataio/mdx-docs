Xata offers general purpose file attachment capabilities. In order to simplify the management of large binary objects and to improve the developer experience, Xata integrates files support directly into the database itself. The aim is to offer a unified, seamless experience by exposing file support under one API, security model, and SDK. Using this approach, the [queries](/docs/sdk/get), [filters](/docs/sdk/filtering), [summaries](/docs/sdk/summarize), [aggregations](/docs/sdk/aggregate) from the SDK can also be used on the files' metadata. The metadata (file name, media type, tags) is also indexed for [search](/docs/sdk/search) so it can be included in search results.

## Schema

To support file attachments, Xata provides two column types:

- [`file` column type](/docs/concepts/data-model#file)
  - The column stores file objects, which are JSON objects with a pre-defined schema.
  - Since the column stores a single file object, the file metadata fields can be used in query filters or in summary queries.
  - Files stored in this column type do not get a file id assigned, as they can be referenced by the record id and column name.
- [`file[]` (file array) column type](/docs/concepts/data-model#file)
  - The column stores an array of file item objects.
  - As the column may store an arbitrary number of files, this content cannot be used in query filters or in summary queries.
  - Files stored in this array column type carry a file id so they can be referenced in endpoints such as the binary File API.

A full breakdown of the `file` and `file[]` column types can be found on the [data model](/docs/concepts/data-model#file) page.

## Content delivery network (CDN)

File attachments are delivered through an integrated content delivery network (CDN) which minimizes access latency by using regional caches.

Caching is enabled for all signed and public URLs. This is to avoid caching data that is secured by API key permissions. This feature is enabled by default and doesn't require any configuration. Content from publicly accessible and signed URLs is cached for a duration of 4 hours.

As with all cache systems, the fundamental problem is cache invalidation - maintaining cache access performance while ensuring updated content and preventing outdated entries. In its architectural approach, Xata addresses the issue of cache invalidation by treating file content as dynamic - analogous to data within a database.

Consequently, it's recommended that clients dynamically obtain access URLs from the database, rather than persisting them in static resources. When the target file is modified, URLs can become invalid, resulting in access disruptions if stored externally to the database.

Through the process of generating a new URL after each update, the system prevents the delivery of outdated and stale content, regardless of any caches or proxies between the client and storage service. For the client application, this translates to no need for cache time-to-live (TTL) or waiting for cache invalidation. When the URL is fetched directly from the database, it is guaranteed to retrieve the most recent version of the file available.

## File access URLs

Xata provides three ways to expose a file's URL to any request. This should allow you to build a range of products from public facing websites, to more security minded applications that need to think through authentication. Files are secure by default, with action required through these methods to provide access.

### Authenticated URLs

Authenticated URLs are private URLs that can be used to access a file with a valid Xata API key. They are available in the `url` field of a file object if the file is not configured for public access.

These URLs are especially useful if you need quick, high-throughput, and concurrent download access, with cached data.

<TabbedCode tabs={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  ```ts
  // Disallow this User photo to be accessed publicly at any time by the URL alone
  const user = await xata.db.Users.update('record_id', {
    photo: {
      enablePublicUrl: false
    }
  });

// Retrieve the private URL on the file in the "photo" column
const { url } = user.photo.transform({ quality: 50 });

````

```python
# Disallow this User photo to be accessed publicly at any time by the URL alone
user = xata.records().update("Users", "record_id", {
  "photo": {
    "enablePublicUrl": False
  }
})

# Get the transformed image of the User with the signed URL
img = xata.files().transform("<photo.signedUrl>", {
  "quality": 50
})
````

</TabbedCode>

### Public URLs

A Xata file can be configured for public access, resulting in a URL that is publicly available without the need of an API key or a signature. A public URL does not expire and offers access until the file is reconfigured to remove public access. To enable public access for a file, you can set the `enablePublicUrl` field to `true` in the file's configuration. This is particularly useful for public websites and for sharing public content.

You can use the public URL directly without writing code. For instance:

https://us-east-1.storage.xata.sh/4u1fh2o6p10blbutjnphcste94 is available publicly

<TabbedCode tabs={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  ```ts
  // Allow this user's photo to be accessed publicly at any time by the URL alone
  const user = await xata.db.Users.update('record_id', {
    photo: {
      enablePublicUrl: true
    }
  });

// Retrieve the public URL on the file in the "photo" column
const { url } = user.photo.transform({ quality: 50 });

````

```python
# Allow this user's photo to be accessed publicly at any time by the URL alone
user = xata.records().update("Users", "record_id", {
  "photo": {
    "enablePublicUrl": True
  }
})

# Get the transformed image
img = xata.files().transform("https://us-east-1.storage.xata.sh/4u1fh2o6p10blbutjnphcste94", {
  "quality": 50
})
````

<Alert status="warning">
**Public object caching**
When a public object gets cached, changing permissions will not invalidate the cached entry.
The file is still accessible through old URLs until the cache entry expires in 2h. Xata advises greatest caution when
configuring public access, because in practice there is a delay in changing the permissions back from public to
private.

</Alert>

### Signed URLs

A signed URL offers authenticated access to a file without requiring an API key. The URL contains the key (signature) within it, so anyone holding the URL can get access to the file. The signed URL has a configurable time to live (TTL), which specifies when access to the URL expires. To avoid permanent public access, the TTL can be set to a maximum of 24h.

You can modify the timeout duration of the signed URL for each file by adjusting the `signedUrlTimeout` field within the file object. Please note that `signedUrlTimeout` expects a positive number, defining the timeout duration in seconds. The default value is set to 60 seconds. A file's signed URL can be retrieved by reading or querying the `signedUrl` field of a file object. Use signed URLs when you need temporary access without revealing the API key, such as rendering an image without disclosing a permanent image URL.

<TabbedCode tabs={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  ```ts
  // Set the timeout to 10 minutes for this user's photo
  const user = await xata.db.Users.update('record_id', {
    photo: {
      signedUrlTimeout: 600 // In seconds
    }
  });

// Retrieve the signed URL on the file in the "photo" column
const { signedUrl } = user.photo.transform({ quality: 50 });

````

```python
# Set the timeout to 10 minutes for this user's photo
user = xata.records().update("Users", "record_id", {
  "photo": {
    "signedUrlTimeout": 600 # In seconds
  }
})

# Get the transformed image
img = xata.files().transform("https://us-east-1.storage.xata.sh/4u1fh2o6p10blbutjnphcste94", {
  "quality": 50
})
````
